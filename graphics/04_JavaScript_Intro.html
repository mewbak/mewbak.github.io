<h2>Section 4:&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction to JavaScript</h2>

<p>JavaScript is a programming language that is used on Web pages.
It was first developed by Netscape (the predecessor of Firefox) at about the
same time that Java was introduced, and the name JavaScript was chosen
to ride the tide of Java's increasing popularity.  In spite of the similar
names, the two languages are quite different.  In fact, there is no
standardized language named JavaScript. The standardized language is
officially called ECMAScript, but the name is not widely used in practice,
and versions of JavaScript in actual web browsers don't necessarily
implement the standard exactly.
</p>

<p>We will mostly be interested in the parts of JavaScript that relate
to graphics, using the HTML &lt;canvas&gt; element.  A canvas is a drawing
surface that can appear on a web page, in much the same way that a JPanel is
a drawing surface that can be used in a Java application.  Canvas is a
relatively recent addition to the Web, but it is implemented in all modern
browsers.  Internet Explorer was the last major browser to add canvas
support, but it is implemented in Internet Explorer 9 and later.
Unfortunately, this means that there are still a lot of people using
browsers that don't support canvas.  On the other hand, fortunately for
us, all the browsers that do support it use a fairly standardized version of
JavaScript, and that will allow us to ignore most of the incompatibilities
that have plagued web developers.</p>

<p>This will be a very cursory introduction to JavaScript, covering just
the parts that we will need.  The coverage here is meant for people who
already know Java.  If you really want to learn JavaScript in detail,
you might consider the book <i>JavaScript: The Complete Guide</i>,
6th edition, by David Flanagan.</p>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>The Core Language</h3>
<p>JavaScript is most closely associated with web pages, but in fact it
is a general purpose language that is used in other places too.  There is
a core language that has nothing to do with web pages in particular, and
we begin by looking at that core.</p>

<p><span class="subsection">Variables and Types.</span>&nbsp;
Variables in Java are not typed.  That is, when you declare a variable, you
don't have to declare what type it is, and any variable can refer to data
of any type.  Variables are declared using the keyword <b>var</b>, and they
can optionally be initialized when they are declared:
</p>

<pre>var x, y;
var name = "David";</pre>

<p class="np">A variable that is declared in this way inside a function
is local to that function. ("Function" is the term used for subroutines
in JavaScript.) You can also use global variables in a function,
that is, variables that are declared outside the function.  JavaScript,
by default, allows you to use variables without declaring them.  However, doing
so is generally not a good idea.  You can prevent the use of undeclared variables,
as well as certain other unsafe practices, by including the following statement
at the beginning of your program:</p>

<pre>"use strict";
</pre>

<p>Although variables don't have types, values do.  A value can be a number, a string,
a boolean, an object, or a function.  The fact that a function can be used as a
data value is probably a surprise to you; more  on that later.
There are a number of differences from Java.  When you compare strings using
the == or != operators, the contents of the strings are compared.  There is no
<span class="ptype">char</span> type.  Strings can be written with either single
quotes or double quotes.  There is not a strict distinction between integers and
real numbers.  Division of integers produces a real number, so that 1/2 in
JavaScript is 0.5, not 0 as it would be in Java.  Although there is a
boolean type, you can actually use any type of value in a boolean context.
So, you will often see tests in JavaScript such as</p>

<pre>if (x) { ... }
</pre>

<p class="np">The value of <i>x</i> as a boolean is considered to be false if,
for example, <i>x</i> is the number zero or is the empty string or is <i>null</i>.
Effectively, any type of value can be converted implicitly to boolean.  (JavaScript
sometimes does other implicit conversions that you might not expect.)</p>

<p>The operator <i>typeof</i> can be used to check the type of a value, as in
<i>typeof&nbsp;x</i>.   This expression is a string such as "number", "string",
"boolean", "function", or "object", so that you can make tests such as</p>

<pre>if ( typeof x == "object" ) ...
</pre>

<p class="np">Note that <i>typeof x</i> is "object" for objects of any type,
including arrays.</p>

<p>Like Java, JavaScript uses the special value <i>null</i> to indicate an
empty or non-existing value (but remember that any variable can be null).
JavaScript also has a special value <i>undefined</i> which is the value
of a variable that has not been initialized.  (<i>typeof&nbsp;null</i>
is "object", and <i>typeof&nbsp;undefined</i> is "undefined".)</p>

<p>JavaScript does not have type-casting as it exists in Java.  However,
you can use <i>Number</i>, <i>String</i>, and <i>Boolean</i> as conversion
functions.  For example,</p>

<pre>x = Number(y);
</pre>

<p class="np">will attempt to convert <i>y</i> to a number.  You can apply this,
for example, when <i>y</i> is a string.  If the conversion fails, the value of
<i>x</i> will be <i>NaN</i>, a special value indicating "Not a Number," equivalent
to <i>Double.NaN</i> in Java.  Aside from the exceptions I've mentioned, expressions
are mostly the same in JavaScript as in Java, including things defined in the
<span class="classname">Math</span> class such as <i>Math.random</i>(),
<i>Math.sqrt</i>(), and the constant <i>Math.PI</i>.</p>


<p><span class="subsection">Control Structures.</span>&nbsp;
JavaScript control structures are pretty much the same as in Java,
including <i>if</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>for</i>, <i class="nb">do..while</i>,
and <i>switch</i>.  JavaScript does not have the "foreach" version of
<i>for</i>; instead, it has an explicit <i>foreach</i> control structure
that I will not cover here.  JavaScript has a <i class="nb">try..catch</i>
that is similar to Java's, but since variables are untyped, there is
only one <i>catch</i> block, and it does not declare a type for
the exception.  (That is, you say, "catch&nbsp;(e)" rather than
"catch(Exception&nbsp;e)".)  Any type of value can be thrown.  You might,
for example, throw a string that represents an error message.
</p>

<p><span class="subsection">Defining and Functions.</span>&nbsp;
Functions in Java are defined using the <i>function</i> keyword.
Since variables are untyped, no return type is declared and
parameters do not have declared types.  Here is a typical
function definition:
</p>

<pre>function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}
</pre>

<p class="np">A function can return any type of value, or it can return nothing
(like a <i>void</i> method in Java).  In fact, the same function might sometimes
return a value and sometimes not, although that would not be good style.
JavaScript does not require the number of parameters in a function call to
match the number of parameters in a function definition.  If you provide too
few parameters in the function call, then the extra parameters in the function
definition get the value <i>undefined</i>.  You can check for this in the
function by using the parameter as a test in an <i>if</i> statement.
There can be a good reason for doing this:  It makes it possible to have
optional parameters.  For example, consider
</p>

<pre>function multiple( str, count ) {
     if ( ! count ) {
         count = 2;
     }
     var i;
     var copies = "";
     for (i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
         copies += str;
     }
     return copies;
}</pre>

<p class="np">If no value is provided for <i>count</i>, as in <i>multiple</i>("foo"),
then <i>count</i> will be set to&nbsp;2.  (Of course, that will also happen if
<i>count</i> is 0 or <i>null</i> or <i>false</i> or the empty string.  If you want
to be sure that <i>count</i> is really <i>undefined</i>, you can test 
<i>if (typeof count == "undefined")</i>.)</p>

<p>You can also provide too many values in a function call.  All the values provided
are always available in the function in a special variable named <i>arguments</i>,
which is essentially an array.  For example, this makes it possible to write a
<i>sum</i> function that takes any number of input values:</p>

<pre>function sum() {
    var i;
    var total = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {
         total += arguments[i];
    }
    return total;
}</pre>

<p class="np">With this definition, you can call <i>sum</i>(2,2),
<i>sum</i>(1,2,3,4,5), and even <i>sum</i>().  (The value of the
last function call is zero.)  Note that calling <i>sum</i> with
non-numeric arguments will not produce an error but will not
produce a useful result.</p>

<p><span class="subsection">Functional Programming.</span>&nbsp;
Functions in JavaScript are "first class objects."  This means that functions
are treated as regular data values, and you can do the sort of things with
them that you do with data:  assign them to variables, store them in arrays,
pass them as parameters to functions, return them from functions.  In
fact, it is very common to do all of these things!
</p>

<p>When you define a function using a definition like the ones in the
examples shown above, it's almost the same as assigning a function to
a variable.  For example, given the above definition of the function <i>sum</i>,
you can assign <i>sum</i> to a variable or pass it as a parameter, and you
would be assigning or passing the function.  And if the value of a variable
is a function, you can use the variable just as you would use the function
name, to call the function.  That is, if you do
</p>

<pre>var f = sum;
</pre>

<p class="np">then you can call <i>f</i>(1,2,3), and it will be the  same
as calling <i>sum</i>(1,2,3).  (One difference between defining a function
and assigning a variable is that a function defined by a function definition
can be used anywhere in the program, even before the function definition.
The computer reads the entire program and defines the functions before it
starts executing the program.)</p>

<p>JavaScript even has something like "function literals," that is a way of
writing a function data value just at the point where you need it, without
giving it a name or defining it with a standard function definition.  Such
functions are called <span class="newword">anonymous functions</span>. The
syntax looks like a function definition without a name. Here, for example,
an anonymous function is created and passed as the first parameter to a
function named <i>setTimeout</i>:</p>

<pre>setTimeout( function () {
    alert("Time's Up!");
}, 5000 );</pre>


<p><span class="subsection">Arrays.</span>&nbsp;
Arrays in JavaScript are more similar to Java <span class="classname">ArrayLists</span>
than to Java arrays, since a JavaScript array does not have a fixed size, and it comes
with a large number of methods for performing useful operations the array.  However,
the basic syntax is the same as Java arrays:  If the value of <i>A</i> is an array,
then <i>A.length</i> is the current length of the array, and elements of the array
are referred to as <i>A</i>[0], <i>A</i>[1], <i>A</i>[2], ..., <i>A</i>[<i>A.length</i>&minus;1].
An array value can be created as a list of values between [&nbsp;and&nbsp;].  For example:</p>

<pre>var A = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
var B = [ "foo", "bar" ];
var C = [];
</pre>

<p class="np">The last line in this example creates an empty array, which initially
has length zero.  The <i>push</i> method can be used to add a new element to the end of an
array, increasing its length: <i>A.push</i>(6).  The <i>pop</i> method removes
and returns the last item: <i>A.pop</i>().</p>



<p><span class="subsection">Objects.</span>&nbsp;
JavaScript has objects, but it doesn't exactly have classes, at least not in
the sense that Java does.  An object is essentially a collection of
key/value pairs, where a key is a name (like an instance variable or method
name in Java) that has an associated value.  Note that the value can be an
ordinary data value or a function (which is just another type of data
value in JavaScript).  It is possible to make an object value as a list of
key/value pairs, enclosed by {&nbsp;and&nbsp;}.  For example,
</p>

<pre>var pt = {  x: 17, y: 42 };

var ajaxData = {
    url: "http://some.place.org/ajax.php",
    data: 42,
    onSuccess: function () { alert("It worked!"); },
    onFailure: function (error) { alert("Sorry, it failed: " + error); }
};</pre>

<p class="np">With these definitions, <i>pt</i> is an object.  It has instance
variables <i>pt.x</i>, with value 17, and <i>pt.y</i> with value 42.  <i>ajaxData</i>
is another object with instance variables including <i>ajaxData.url</i>
and <i>ajaxData.onSuccess</i>.  The value of <i>ajaxData.onSuccess</i>
is a function, created here as an anonymous function.
Objects, by the way, are open in the sense that you can add
a new instance variable to an existing object at any time just by assigning
a value.  For example, given the object <i>pt</i> defined above, you could
say</p>

<pre>pt.z = 84;
</pre>

<p class="np">to add <i>z</i> as an instance variable in the object with
value 84.  By the way, the term "instance variable" is not usually used
in JavaScript; the preferred term is <span class="newword">property</span>.</p>

<p>Although JavaScript doesn't (quite) have classes, it does have constructors,
which can be called with the <i>new</i> operator to create objects.
For example, </p>

<pre>var now = new Date();</pre>

<p class="np">This calls the constructor <i>Date</i>(), which is a standard part
of JavaScript.  When called with no parameters, <i>new&nbsp;Date</i>() constructs
an object that represents the current date and time.</p>

<p>A constructor is written like an ordinary function; by convention, the name of
a constructor function begins with an upper case letter.  In some sense,
a constructor actually defines a class.  <i>Date</i>, for example, is often
referred to as a class.  It is possible to write a function that can be used
as a constructor, and doing so defines something that is as close to a class
as JavaScript comes.  For example, let's see how to define a class to
represent points in 2D:</p>

<pre>function Point2D(x,y) {
    if (x) {
        this.x = x;
    }
    else {
        this.x = 0;
    }
    if (y) {
        this.y = y;
    }
    else {
        this.y = 0;
    }
    this.move = function(dx,dy) {
        this.x = this.x + dx;
        this.y = this.y + dy;
    }
}</pre>

<p class="np">When called with the <i>new</i> operator, this function creates
an object that has properties <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>move</i>.
The fact that the value of <i>move</i> is a function makes it more like
an instance method than an instance variable.  Consider:</p>

<pre>var p1 = new Point2D(17.42);
var p2 = new Point2D();
</pre>

<p class="np">The values of these variables are objects, and we would
say that they are "objects of type <span class="classname">Point2D".  </span><i>p1.x</i>
is 42 and <i>p1.y</i> is 17.  Calling <i>p1.move</i>(1,2) will change
the values of the properties to <i>p1.x = 18</i> and <i>p1.y = 43</i>.
(It is also possible to change these variables directly with assignment
statements.)  Note that <i>p2</i> is created with the default value of zero
for <i>p2.x</i> and <i>p2.y</i>.</p>

<p>The definition of the <i>move</i> method in this example is not done
in the best way possible.  The problem is that every object of type
<span class="classname">Point2D</span> gets its own copy of <i>move</i>.
That is, the code that defines <i>move</i> is duplicated for each
object that is created.  The solution is to use something called the
<span class="newword">prototype</span> of the function <i>Point2D</i>.
This takes us farther than I want to go into programming with objects,
but here is a more efficient definition:
</p>

<pre>function Point2D(x,y) {
    if (x) {
        this.x = x;
    }
    else {
        this.x = 0;
    }
    if (y) {
        this.y = y;
    }
    else {
        this.y = 0;
    }
}

Point2D.prototype.move = function(dx,dy) {
    this.x = this.x + dx;
    this.y = this.y + dy;
}
</pre>
    
<p class="np">The properties of the prototype are shared by all objects
of type <span class="classname">Point2D</span>.  In this case, there
is only one copy of <i>move</i>, which is used by all such objects.</p>

<p>Although writing "classes" in JavaScript is very different from writing
them in Java, using classes once you have them is pretty much the same in
both languages.</p>

<p>A few more comments:  Making things that act like subclasses is tricky,
but possible.  I won't discuss it here.  The special variable <i>this</i>
is subtly different in JavaScript from <i>this</i> in Java.  One consequence
is that when defining methods in JavaScript, instance variables and
instance methods can only be referred to using <i>this</i>.  If <i>x</i>
is an instance variable, for example, it has to be referenced as <i>this.x</i>
in the method definition.</p>


</div>



<div class="subsection">
<h3>JavaScript on Web Pages</h3>
<p>There are three ways to include JavaScript code on web pages (that is, in HTML files).
First, you can include it inside &lt;script&gt; elements, which have the form</p>
<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    
    // ... JavaScript code goes here ...
    
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p class="np">Second, you can put JavaScript code in a separate file, usually with a
name ending with ".js", and import that
file into the web page.  A JavaScript file can be imported using a variation of the
&lt;script&gt; tag that has the form
</p>

<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="filename.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p class="np">where "filename.js" should be replaced by the URL, relative or
absolute, of the JavaScript file.  The closing tag, &lt;/script&gt, is
required here to mark the end of the script, even though it is <b>not</b> permitted
to have any code inside the script element.  (If you do, it will be ignored.)
Importing JavaScript code from a file in this way has the same effect as typing the
code from the file directly into the web page.
</p>

<p>Script elements of either type are often included in the &lt;head&gt; section of
an HTML file, but they can actually occur at any point, and you can use any number
of script elements on the same page.</p>

<p>The third way to use JavaScript on a web page is in <span class="newword">event
handlers</span> that can occur inside HTML elements.  For example, consider</p>

<pre>&lt;h1 onclick="doClickHeader()"&gt;My Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>

<p class="np">Here, the <i>onclick</i> handler defines an event handler that will
be executed when the user clicks on the text of the &lt;h1&gt; element.  The value
of an event handler attribute such as <i>onclick</i> can be any JavaScript code.
It can include multiple statements, separated by semicolons, and can even extend over several lines.
Here, the code is <tt>doClickHandler()</tt>, so that clicking the &lt;h1&gt; element
will cause the JavaScript function <i>doClickHandler</i>() to be called.  I should note
that this is not the only way to attach a JavaScript function to an event, and it is
considered a somewhat old-fashioned way of doing so.  However, I will use it occasionally.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that all the JavaScript code in &lt;script&gt; elements,
including code in imported files, is read and executed as the page is being loaded.  Usually,
most of the code in such scripts consists of variable initializations and the definitions
of functions that are meant to be called after the page has loaded, in response to events.
Furthermore, all the scripts on a page are part of the same program.  For example, you
can define a variable or function in one script, even in an imported file, and then use
it in another script.</p>

<hr class="break">
    
<p>JavaScript on web pages includes several standard functions that allow you to
interact with the user using dialog boxes.  The simplest of these is
<i>alert</i>(<i>message</i>), which will display <i>message</i> to the user
in a pop-up dialog box, with an "OK" button that the user can click to dismiss the
message.</p>

<p>The function <i>prompt</i>(<i>question</i>) will display <i>question</i> in a dialog
box, along with an input field where the user can enter a response.  The <i>prompt</i>
function returns the user's response as its return value.   This type of dialog
box comes with an "OK" button and with a "Cancel" button.  If the user hits
"Cancel", the return value from <i>prompt</i> is <i>null</i>.  If the user hits
"OK", the return value is the content of the input field, which might be the empty
string.</p>

<p>The function <i>confirm</i>(<i>question</i>) displays <i>question</i> in a dialog
box along with "Yes" and "Cancel" buttons.  The return value is <i>true</i> or
<i>false</i>, depending on whether the user hits "OK" or "Cancel".</p>

<p>Here, for example, is a simple guessing game that uses these functions for
user interaction:</p>

<pre>alert("I will pick a number between 1 and 100.\n"
         + "Try to guess it!");
         
do {

    var number = Math.floor( 1 + 100*Math.random() );
    var guesses = 1;
    var guess = Number( prompt("What's your guess?") );
    while (guess != number ) {
        if ( isNaN(guess) || guess &lt; 1 || guess &gt; 100 ) { 
            guess = Number( prompt("Please enter an integer\n"
                              + "in the range 1 to 100") );
        }
        else if (guess &lt; number) {
            guess = Number( prompt("Too low.  Try again!") );
            guesses++;
        }
        else {
            guess = Number( prompt("Too high.  Try again!") );
            guesses++;
        }
    }
    alert("You got it in " + guesses + " guesses.");
    
} while ( confirm("Play again?") );
</pre>

<p class="np">(This program uses <i>Number</i>() to convert the user's
response to a number.  If the response is <i>null</i> or empty or cannot be
parsed as a number, then the value will be the non-a-number value <i>NaN</i>.
The function <i>isNaN</i>(<i>guess</i>) is used to check whether the value
of <i>guess</i> is this special non-a-number value.  It's not possible to do
that by saying <span class="nb">"if (guess == NaN)"</span> since the
expression <span class="nb">NaN == NaN</span> evaluates to <i>false</i>!
The same, by the way, is true of the non-a-number value in Java.)
</p>

<hr class="break">
    
<p>You can try out JavaScript code in <span class="newword">JavaScript consoles</span> that
are available in many web browsers.  In Firefox, for example, you can access a console
with the "Tools" / "Web&nbsp;Developer" / "Web Console" command.  This will show the
web console at the bottom of the Firefox window, with a JavaScript input field at the
very bottom.  When you type a line of JavaScript and press return, it is executed, and its
value is output in the console.  The code is evaluated in the context of the current web
page, so you can even enter commands that affect that page.  The Web console also shows
JavaScript errors that occur when code on the current web page is executed, and JavaScript
code can write a message to the console by calling <i>console.log</i>(<i>message</i>)</i>,
so the console is very useful for debugging.  (Note: Once your code is running, you should
remove the <i>console.log</i> commands, since they can cause errors on some browsers.)
The Firefox Web Developer tools include many useful features, and you might want to keep
the console available while working on your code.  Note that you can detach the
developer tools into a separate window, if you want.
</p>

<p>The Chrome browser has its own set of developer tools.  Its JavaScript console
can be accessed under "Tools" / "JavaScript&nbsp;Console".  In the Safari browser,
use "Show&nbsp;Error&nbsp;Console" in the "Develop" menu (but note that the
Develop menu has to be enabled in the Safari Preferences, under the "Advanced" tab).
In Internet Explorer (version 8 and higher), access its "Developer Tools" by hitting
the F12 key.</p>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Working with the Web Page</h3>

<p>JavaScript code on a web page can manipulate the content and the style of
that page.  It can do this because of the <span class="newword">DOM</span>
(<span class="newword">Document Object Model</span>).  When a web page is loaded,
everything on the page is encoded into a data structure, defined by the DOM,
which can be accessed from JavaScript as a collection of objects.  There are
several ways to get references to these object, but I will discuss only one:
<i>document.getElementById</i>.  Any element on a web page can have an <i>id</i>
attribute.  For example:</p>

<pre>&lt;img src="somepicture.jpg" id="pic"&gt;</pre>

<p class="np">or</p>

<pre>&lt;h1 id="mainhead"&gt;My Page&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>

<p class="np">An id should be unique on the page, so that an element is uniquely
identified by its id.  Any element is represented by a DOM object.  If an element
has an id, you can obtain a reference to that element by passing
the id to the function <i>document.getElementById</i>.  For example:</p>

<pre>var image = document.getElementById("pic");
var heading = document.getElementById("mainhead");
</pre>

<p>Once you have a DOM object, you can use it to manipulate the element that it
represents.  For example, the content of the element is given by the
<i>innerHTML</i> property of the object.  The value is a string containing
text or HTML code.  In our example, the value of
<i>heading.innerHTML</i> is the string "My&nbsp;Page".  Furthermore, you
can assign a value to this property, and doing so will change the content
of the element. For example:</p>

<pre>heading.innerHTML = "New Headline!";
</pre>

<p class="np">This does not just change the value of the property in the object;
it actually changes the text that is displayed on the web page!  This will seem odd
to a Java programmer: It's an assignment statement that has a side effect.  But that's
the way the DOM works.  A change to the DOM data structure that represents a web
page will actually modify the page and change its display in the web browser.</p>

<p>Some attributes of elements become properties of the objects that represent them.
This is true for the <i>src</i> attribute of an image element, so that in our
example, we could say</p>

<pre>image.src = "anotherpicture.jpg";
</pre>

<p class="np">to change the source of the image element.  Again, this is a "live"
assignment: When the assignment statement is executed, the image on the web page
changes.</p>

<p>The DOM object for an element has a property named <i>style</i> that is itself
an object, representing the CSS style of the object.   The <i>style</i> object
has properties such as <i>color</i>, <i>backgroundColor</i>, and <i>fontSize</i>
representing CSS properties.  By assigning values to these properties, you can
change the appearance of the element on the page.  For example,</p>

<pre>heading.color = "red";
heading.fontSize = "150%";
</pre>

<p class="np">will make the text in the &lt;h1&gt; element red and 50% larger than usual.
The value of a style property must be a string that would be a legal value for the corresponding
CSS style.
</p>

<p>Most interesting along these lines, perhaps, are properties of input elements, since
they make it possible to program interaction with the user.  Suppose that on a web page, we have</p>

<pre>&lt;input type="text" id="textin"&gt;

&lt;select id="sel"&gt;
   &lt;option&gt;Option 1&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
   &lt;option&gt;Option 2&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
   &lt;option&gt;Option 3&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;input type="checkbox" id="check"&gt;
</pre>

<p class="np">and in JavaScript</p>

<pre>var textin = document.getElementById("textin");
var sel = document.getElmenntById("sel");
var check = document.getElementById("check");
</pre>

<p class="np">Then the value of the property <i>checkbox.checked</i> is a boolean that
can be tested to determine whether the checkbox is checked or not, and its value can
be set to check or uncheck the box programmatically.  The value of
<i>checkbox.disabled</i> is a boolean that tells whether the checkbox is disabled.
(The user can't change the value of a disabled checkbox.)  Again, you can both test
and set this value.  The properties <i>sel.disabled</i> and <i>textin.disabled</i> do
the same thing for the &lt;select&gt; menu and the text input box.
The properties <i>textin.value</i> and <i>sel.value</i> give the current values of
those elements.  The value of a text input is the text that is currently in the box.
The value of a &lt;select&gt; element is the value of the currently selected
option.  As an example, here is complete source code for a web page that implements a
guessing game using a text input box and buttons:</p>

<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Guessing Game&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    "use strict";
    var number = Math.floor( 1 + 100*Math.random() );
    var guessCount = 0;
    var guessMessage = "Your guesses so far: ";
    function guess() {
        var userNumber = Number( document.getElementById("guess").value );
        document.getElementById("guess").value = "";
        if ( isNaN(userNumber) || userNumber &lt; 1 || userNumber &gt; 100 ) {
            document.getElementById("question").innerHTML =
               "Bad input!&lt;br&gt;Try again with an integer in the range 1 to 100.";
        }
        else if (userNumber == number) {
            guessCount++;
            document.getElementById("question").innerHTML =
                "You got it in " + guessCount + " guesses. " +
                userNumber + " is correct.&lt;br&gt;" + 
                "I have picked another number.  Make a guess!";
            number = Math.floor( 1 + 100*Math.random() );
            guessCount = 0;
            guessMessage = "Your guesses so far: ";
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "";
        }
        else if (userNumber &lt; number) {
            guessCount++;
            document.getElementById("question").innerHTML =
                userNumber + " is too low.&lt;br&gt;Try again.";
            guessMessage += " " + userNumber;
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = guessMessage;
        }
        else {
            guessCount++;
            document.getElementById("question").innerHTML =
                userNumber + " is too high.&lt;br&gt;Try again.";
            guessMessage += " " + userNumber;
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = guessMessage;
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p id="question"&gt;I will pick a number between 1 and 100&lt;br&gt;
     Try to guess it.  What is your first guess?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" id="guess"&gt;
       &lt;button onclick="guess()"&gt;Make Guess&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p id="message"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<hr class="break">
    
<p>Here's one problem with some of my discussion.  Suppose that a script uses
<i>document.getElementById</i> to get the DOM object for some HTML element. If that
script is executed before the page has finished loading, the element that it is
trying to access might not yet
exist.  And remember that scripts are executed as the page is loading.  Of course,
one solution is to call <i>document.getElementById</i> only in functions that
are executed after the page is complete; that's what I did in the previous example.
But sometimes, you want to assign a DOM object to a global variable.  Where should
you do that?  One possibility is to put the script at the end of the page.  That
will probably work.  Another, more common technique is to put the assignment into
a function and arrange for that function to run after the page has finished loading,
when it will be safe.  To do that, you have to work with events.  When the browser
has finished loading the page and building its DOM representation, it fires a
<i>load</i> event.  You can arrange for some JavaScript code to be called to
respond to that event.  A common way of doing this is to add an <i>onload</i>
event-handler to the &lt;body&gt; tag:
</p>

<pre>&lt;body onload="init()"&gt;
</pre>

<p class="np">This will call a function named <i>init</i> when the page has loaded.
You would provide a definition for the function that includes any initialization
code that your program needs.</p>

<p>You can define similar event-handlers in other elements.
For &lt;input&gt; and &lt;select&gt; elements,
you can supply an <i>onchange</i> event-handler that will be executed when
the user changes the value associated with the element.  For example, this
allows you to respond when the user checks or unchecks a checkbox or selects
a new option from a select menu.  I mentioned the
<i>onclick</i> event-handler above, which can be applied to any visible element but
is probably most useful for buttons.  There are several other events that
are generated by the mouse.  For example, <i>onmouseover</i> is for the
event that occurs when the mouse is moved into an element, and
<i>onmouseout</i> is for when the mouse moves out of the element.  It might
be worth mentioning that in the event-handling code, the special variable
<i>this</i> can be used to refer to the element on which the event occurs.
For example:
</p>

<pre>&lt;p onmouseover="this.style.backgroundColor='yellow'"
       onmouseout="this.style.backgroundColor='white'"&gt;
    Move your mouse over me!
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p class="np">Furthermore, a mouse event handler can use a special variable <i>event</i>
to refer to an object that contains information about the event.  For example,
<i>event.clientX</i> and <i>event.clientY</i> give the location of the mouse
in the browser window:</p>

<pre>&lt;p onclick="alert( 'Clicked at ' + event.clientX + ',' + event.clientY )"&gt;
    Click me!
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p class="np">Of course, it would be more likely to call a function in response to the event,
as in <tt>onclick="doClick(event)"</tt>.</p>

<p>As nice as all this is, it's not the preferred way of setting up event handling.
For one thing, the mixing of JavaScript code and HTML code is often considered to be
bad style.  And there is another way to do it that offers more flexibility:
Use the <i>addEventListener</i> function, which is defined as a method in DOM objects (at least
in modern browsers, including all of those that support the HTML canvas element).  If <i>elem</i>
is a DOM object representing some element, you can, for example, use the following statement
to set up event-handling for mouse-click events on that element:</p>

<pre>elem.addEventListener( "click", handler, false );
</pre>

<p class="np">The first parameter is a string that gives the name of the event. The name is
the same as the name of the event attribute in HTML, with "on" stripped off the front:
<i>onclick</i> becomes "click".  The second parameter is the function that will be called
when the event occurs.  It can be given as the name of a function or as an
anonymous function.  The event object will be passed to that function as a parameter.
The third parameter is harder to explain and will, for our purposes, always be false.</p>

<p>This technique is more flexible because of the third, boolean parameter (which I'm not
about to explain) and because it allows you to set up more than one event handler for
the same event.</p>
