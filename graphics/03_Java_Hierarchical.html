<h2>Section 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; Hierarchical Modeling in Java</h2>

<p>We return in this section to the idea of using transformations to
draw objects in a scene.  In particular, we will consider complex scenes,
in which complex objects are composed of simpler objects, which can 
themselves be made up of even simpler objects.  The structure of
such objects is hierarchical, and their construction is referred
to as "hierarchical modeling."</p>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Hierarchical Modeling</h3>

<p>A major motivation for introducing a new coordinate system is that it should be
possible to use the coordinate system that is most natural to the scene that you want to
draw.  We can extend this idea to individual objects in a scene:  When drawing an object,
it should be possible to use the coordinate system that is most natural to the object.
Geometric transformations allow us to specify the object using whatever coordinate system
we want, and then to apply a transformation to the object to place it wherever we want it
in the scene.  Recall that transformations used in this way are called modeling transformations.
</p>

<p>Usually, we want an object in its natural coordinates to be centered at the origin, (0,0),
or at least to use the origin as a convenient reference point.  Then, to place it in
the scene, we can use a scaling transform, followed by a rotation, followed by a translation
to set its size, orientation, and position in the scene. (Of course, in a particular case,
you might not need all three operations.)  Since scaling and rotation leave the
origin fixed, those operations don't move the reference point for the object.  The translation
is then used to move the reference point, and the object along with it, to any
other point.  Remember that in the code,
the transformations are specified in the opposite order from the order in which they are
applied to the object and that the transformations are specified before drawing the
object.  So in the code, the translation would come first, followed by the rotation and
then the scaling.  Modeling transformations are not always composed in this order, but
it is the most common usage.
</p>

<p>The modeling transformations that are used to place an object in the scene should not
affect other objects in the scene.  To limit their application to just the one object,
we can save the current transformation before starting work on the object and restore it
afterwards.  In Java, the code could look something like this,
where <i>g</i> is a <span class="classname">Graphics2D</span>:
</p>

<pre>AffineTransform saveTransform = g.getTransform();
g.translate(a,b); // move object into position
g.rotate(r); // set the orientation of the object
g.scale(s,s); // set the size of the object
  ...  // draw the object, using its natural coordinates
g.setTransform(saveTransform);  // restore the previous transform</pre>

<p>Note that we can't simply assume that the original transform is the identity transform.  There
might be another transform in place, such as a coordinate transform that affects the scene as a whole.
The modeling transform for the object is effectively applied in addition to any other transform that
was specified previously.  The modeling transform moves the object from its natural coordinates into its
proper place in the scene.  Then on top of that, a coordinate transform is applied to the scene as a whole, carrying
the object along with it.
</p>

<p>Now let's extend this a bit.  Suppose that the object that we want to draw is itself a complex 
picture, made up of a number of smaller objects.  Think, for example, of a potted flower made up of
pot, stem, leaves, and bloom.  We would like to be able to draw the smaller component objects in their
own natural coordinate systems, just as we do the main object.  For example, we would like to specify
the bloom in a coordinate system in which the center of the bloom is at (0,0).
But this is easy:  We draw each small component object, such as the bloom,
in its own coordinate system, and use a modeling transformation to move the small object
into position <i>within the main object</i>.  On top of that, we can apply <i>another</i> modeling
transformation to the main object, to move it into the completed scene; its component objects are 
carried along with it.  In fact, we can build objects that are made up of smaller objects which in turn
are made up of even smaller objects, to any level. For example, we can draw the bloom's petals in
their own coordinate system, then apply modeling transformations to place the petals into the
bloom's coordinate system.  This type of modeling is known as
<span class="newword">hierarchical modeling</span>.
</p>

<p>Let's look at a simple example.  Suppose that we want to draw a simple 2D image of a cart with
two wheels.  We will draw the body of the cart as a rectangle.  For the wheels, suppose that we
have written a method
</p>

<pre>private void drawWheel(Graphics2D g2)</pre>

<p class="np">that draws a wheel.  The wheel is drawn using its own natural coordinate system.  Let's say that
in this coordinate system, the wheel is centered at (0,0) and has radius&nbsp;1.
</p>

<p>In the cart's coordinate system, I found it convenient to use the midpoint of the base of the
rectangle as the reference point.  I 
assume that the positive direction of the <i>y</i>-axis points upward, which is the common
convention in mathematics.  The rectangular body of the cart will have 
width 5 and height 2, so the coordinates of the lower left corner of the rectangle are (&minus;2.5,0).
To complete the cart, we need
to add <i>two</i> wheels to the rectangle.  To make the size of the wheels fit the cart, we will probably have to scale
them.  To place them in the correct positions relative to body of the cart, we have to translate
one wheel to the left and one wheel to the right.  When I coded this example, I had to play
around with the numbers to get the right sizes and positions for the wheels, and I also found
that the wheels looked better if I also moved them down a bit.  Using the usual techniques of
hierarchical modeling, we have to remember to save the current transform and to restore it after
drawing each wheel. This limits the effect of the modeling transformation for the wheel
to that wheel alone, so that it does not affect any other part of the cart.
Here is a subroutine that I use to draw the cart in its own coordinate system:</p>

<pre>private void drawCart(Graphics2D g2) {
    AffineTransform tr = g2.getTransform();  // save the current transform
    g2.translate(-1.5,-0.1);  // center of first wheel will be at (-1.5,-0.1)
    g2.scale(0.8,0.8);  // scale to reduce radius from 1 to 0.8
    drawWheel(g2); // draw the first wheel
    g2.setTransform(tr);  // restore the transform 
    g2.translate(1.5,-0.1);  // center of second wheel will be at (1.5,-0.1)
    g2.scale(0.8,0.8); // scale to reduce radius from 1 to 0.8
    drawWheel(g2); // draw the second wheel
    g2.setTransform(tr);  // restore the transform
    g2.setColor(Color.RED);
    g2.fill(new Rectangle2D.Double(-2.5,0,5,2) ); // draw the body of the cart
}
</pre>

<p class="np">It's important to note that the same subroutine is used to draw both wheels.  The reason that
two wheels appear in the picture in different positions is that different modeling transformations are in effect for the
two subroutine calls.</p>

<p>Once we have this cart-drawing subroutine, we can use it to add a cart to a scene.
When we do this, we can apply another modeling transformation to the cart as a whole.  Indeed, we could add several carts
to the scene, if we want, by calling the <i>cart</i> subroutine several times with different modeling transformations.
</p>

<p>You should notice the analogy here:  Building up a complex scene out of objects is similar to
building up a complex program out of subroutines.  In both cases, you can work on pieces of the
problem separately, you can compose a solution to a big problem from solutions to smaller problems,
and once you have solved a problem, you can reuse that solution in several places.
</p>

<p>Here is our cart used in a scene.  You can also view a
<a href="canvas/cart-and-windmills.html">live&nbsp;demo</a> in which the
scene is animated.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/03/cart-and-windmill.png" width="700" height="500"></p>

<p class="np">You can probably guess how hierarchical modeling is used to draw the windmills in this example.
There is a <i>drawWindmill</i> method that draws a windmill in its own coordinate system.  Each of the
windmills in the scene is then produced by applying a different modeling transform to the standard
windmill.  Furthermore, the windmill is itself a complex object that is constructed from several
sub-objects using various modeling transformations.</p>

<p>It might not be so easy to see how different parts of the scene can be animated.  In fact, animation
is just another aspect of modeling.  A computer animation consists of a sequence of frames.  Each frame
is a separate image, with small changes from one frame to the next.  From our point of view, each frame
is a separate scene and has to be drawn separately.  The same object can appear in many frames.  To
animate the object, we can simply apply a different modeling transformation to the object in each
frame.  The parameters used in the transformation can be computed from the current time or from the frame number.
To make a cart move from left to right, for example, we might apply a modeling transformation</p>

<pre>g2.translate(frameNumber * 0.1);
</pre>

<p class="np">to the cart, where <i>frameNumber</i> is the frame number.
In each frame, the cart will be 0.1 units farther to the right than in the previous
frame.  (In fact, in the actual program, the translation that is applied to the cart is
</p>

<pre>g2.translate(-3 + 13*(frameNumber % 300) / 300.0, 0);
</pre>

<p class="np">which moves the reference point of the cart from &minus;3 to 13 along the horizontal axis
every 300 frames.)</p>

<p>The really neat thing is that this type of animation works with hierarchical modeling.  For example,
the <i>drawWindmill</i> method doesn't just draw a windmill&mdash;it draws an <i>animated</i> windmill,
with turning vanes.  That just means that the rotation applied to the vanes depends on the frame 
number.  When a modeling transformation is applied to the windmill, the rotating vanes are scaled and
moved as part of the object as a whole.  This is actually an example of hierarchical modeling.
The vanes are sub-objects of the windmill.  The rotation of the vanes is part of the modeling
transformation that places the vanes into the windmill object.  Then a further modeling transformation
can be applied to the windmill object to place it in the scene.
</p>

<p>The file <span class="sourceref"><a href="java/HierarchicalModeling2DExample.java">HierarchicalModeling2DExample.java</a></span> contains
the complete source code for a Java version of this example.  You are strongly encouraged to read it,
especially the <i>paintComponent</i>() method, which composes the entire scene.

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Scene Graphs</h3>

<p>Logically, the components of a complex scene form a structure.  In this structure,
each object is associated with the sub-objects that it contains.  If the scene is hierarchical,
then the structure is hierarchical.  This structure is known as a
<span class="classname">scene&nbsp;graph</span>.  A scene graph is a tree-like structure,
with the root representing the entire scene, the children of the root representing the
top-level objects in the scene, and so on.  We can visualize the scene graph for our
sample scene:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/03/scene-graph.png" width="567" height="778"></p>
</div>

<p class="np">In this drawing, a single object can have several connections to one or
more parent objects.  Each connection represents one occurrence of the object in its
parent objects.  For example, the "filled square" object occurs as a sub-object
in the cart, in the windmill, and in the scene as a whole (where it represents the road).
The "filled circle" is used in the sun and three times in the wheel.  The "line"
is used 12 times in the sun and 12 times in the wheel.  (I've drawn one arrow, marked
with a 12, to represent the 12 connections.)  The wheel, in turn, is used twice in
the cart.  Each arrow in the picture can be associated with a modeling transformation
that places the sub-object into its parent object.  When an object contains several
copies of a sub-object, each arrow connecting the sub-object to the object will have
a different associated modeling transformation.  The object is the same for each copy;
only the transformation differs.</p>

<p>In the sample Java program, the scene graph exists only implicitly.  It is implemented
"procedurally," that is, by calling subroutines:  The scene graph represents
the sequence of subroutine calls that draw the scene.  Each node in the graph is a subroutine,
and each arrow is a subroutine call.  Before a subroutine is called, the current transformation
is saved, and a modeling transformation is applied.  After the subroutine returns,
the saved transformation is restored.  The subroutine draws the object in its own
coordinate system, possibly calling other subroutines to draw sub-objects with their
own modeling transformations.  (This is not quite true in the example program, since in that
program some objects are drawn directly rather than by calling subroutines.)</p>

<p>It is also possible for a scene graph to be represented by an actual data structure.
In an object-oriented approach, the graphical objects in the scene are represented by
program objects.  There are many ways to build an object-oriented scene graph API.
As a very basic example, you can look at
<a href="java/SceneGraphAPI2D.java">SceneGraphAPI2D.java</a>.  This program draws
the same animated scene as the previous example, but it represents the scene with
an object-oriented data structure rather than procedurally.  For simplicity, I have
implemented the scene graph API as a collection of static nested classes in the main class.</p>

<p>In this program, a node in the scene graph data structure is reprented by an
object of type <span class="classname">SceneGraphNode</span>.  <span class="classname">SceneGraphNode</span>
is an abstract class that has an abstact method</p>

<pre>abstract void doDraw(Graphics2D g);</pre>

<p class="np">that is responsible for drawing the graphical object that is represented
by the node.   It also contains a <i>draw</i>() method that calls <i>doDraw</i>() and does
some extra work (<i>doDraw</i>() is meant to be overridden in subclasses; <i>draw</i>() is
meant to be called).  <span class="classname">SceneGraphNode</span> has a subclass
<span class="classname">CompoundObject</span>, which represents complex objects
that are made up of sub-objects.  It is defined very simply as</p>

<pre>static class CompoundObject extends SceneGraphNode {
    ArrayList&lt;SceneGraphNode&gt; subobjects = new ArrayList&lt;SceneGraphNode&gt;();
    CompoundObject add(SceneGraphNode node) {
        subobjects.add(node);
        return this;
    }
    void doDraw(Graphics2D g) {
        for (SceneGraphNode node : subobjects)
           node.draw(g);
    }
}
</pre>

<p class="np">That is, a <span class="classname">CompoundObject</span> contains a list
of sub-objects, and its <i>doDraw</i>() method simiply draws each of the subjects.
In the program, the entire scene is represented by a variable named <i>world</i>
of type <span class="classname">CompoundObject</span>.  To draw the scene in the
<i>paintComponent</i>() method, it is only necessary to call
<i>world.draw</i>(<i>g2</i>).  Most of the work is done in a method named
<i>createWorld</i>(), which builds the complete scene graph and sets <i>world</i>
to refer to it.</p>

<p>A decision has to be made about how to handle transforms.  One option is to allow
transformations to be associated with any node in the scene graph.  In this case, however,
I decided to use special nodes to represent transforms as
objects of type  <span class="classname">TransformedObject</span>.
A <span class="classname">TransformedObject</span> is a <span class="classname">SceneGraphNode</span>
contains a link to another <span class="classname">SceneGraphNode</span> and also contains a
modeling transformation that is to be applied to that object.
The modeling transformation is given in terms of scaling, rotation, and translation amounts
that are instance variables in the object.  It is worth noting that these are always applied
in the order scale, then rotate, then translate, no matter what order the instance variables
are set in the code; if you want to do a translation followed by a rotation, you will need
two <span class="classname">TransformedObjects</span> to implement it.
It is also worth noting that the setter methods for the scaling,
rotation, and translation return <i>this</i> as their return value.  This makes it possible
to chain calls to the methods in a single statement such as</p>

<pre>object.setScale(5,2).setTranslation(3.5,0);
</pre>

<p class="np">and even say things like</p>

<pre>world.add( new TransformedObject(windmill).setScale(0.4,0.4).setTranslation(2.2,1.3) );
</pre>

<p class="np">Note that the same thing was done with the <i>add</i>() method in
<span class="classname">CompoundObject</span>.  This type of chaining can make for
more compact code and can eliminate the need for a lot of extra temporary variables.</p>

<p>Another decision has to be made about how to handle color.  One possibility would be
to make a <span class="classname">ColoredObject</span> class similar to
<span class="classname">TransformedObject</span>.  However, in this case I just added
a <i>setColor</i>() method to the main <span class="classname">ScreenGraphNode</span>
class.  A color that is set on a compound object is inherited by its subobjects,
unless a different color is set on a sub-object.  That is, a color on a compound object
is a default color for its sub-objects, but color can be overridden on the sub-objects.
</p>

<p>In addition to compound objects and transformed objects, we need scene graph
nodes to represent the basic objects that occupy the leaves of the scene graph.
These are the nodes that do the actual drawing in the end.  In the example program,
I used several anonymous nested classes to represent basic objects.</p>

<p>For those who are familiar with data structures, I will note that
a scene graph is actually an example of a "directed acyclic graph" or "dag."
The process of drawing the scene involves a traversal of this dag.  The
term "acyclic" means that there can't be cycles in the graph.  For a scene graph,
this is the obvious requirement that an object cannot be a sub-object, either
directly or indirectly, of itself.</p>


<div class="subsection">
<h3>The Matrix Stack</h3>

<p>Suppose that you write a subroutine to draw an object. At the beginning of the
subroutine, you use <i>g.getTransform</i>() to save a copy of the current transform
in the graphics context.  At the end of the subroutine, you call <i>g.setTransform</i>()
to restore that transform.  You are effectively keeping the copy of the transform
on a stack, namely the subroutine call stack.  When you draw complex objects, several
drawing subroutines can be active at once, and there can be several saved transforms
on the stack.</p>

<p>As an alternative to saving the transforms in local variables on the subroutine call stack,
it's possible to use an ordinary stack data structure.  For 2D graphics in Java, you would
use an object of type <i>Stack</i>&lt;<i>AffineTransform</i>&gt;.  Before you start
drawing an object, you would push the current transform onto the stack.  After drawing
the object, you would pop the transform from the stack.  It might look something
like this:</p>

<pre>Stack&lt;AffineTransform&gt; stack = new Stack&lt;AffineTransform&gt;();

void pushTransform(Graphics2D g) {
    stack.push( g.getTransform() );
}

void popTransform(Graphics2D g) {
    g.setTransform( stack.pop() );
}

void drawSomeObject(Graphics2D g) {
    pushTransform(g);
    //  ...  do the drawing, possibly calling more drawing subroutines
    popTransform(g);
}
</pre>

<p class="np">Some graphics APIs come with transform stacks already defined.
For example, the original OpenGL API includes the functions
<i>glPushMatrix</i>() and <i>glPopMatrix</i>() for using a stack of transformations
that is built into OpenGL.  The stack is usually called a <span class="newword">matrix stack</span>
rather than a transformation stack because, as we will see later, transformations are
actually implemented using matrices.
</p>

<p>As we turn to the HTML canvas API for 2D graphics, we'll see that it includes
methods named <i>save</i>() and <i>restore</i>() that are actually <i>push</i>
and <i>pop</i> operations on a stack.  These methods are essential to implementing
hierarchical graphics for an HTML canvas.</p>
