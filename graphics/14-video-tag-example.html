<h2>An Example for Section 14: Using the &lt;video&gt; Tag</h2>

<p>This page contains an example of using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt;
tag to show an animation produced with Blender.  It is a
supplement to <a href="14_Blender_Animation.html">Section&nbsp;14</a>
of this set of notes.</p>

<p>The animation shows hierarchical rotational motion implemented
in Blender.  Two cubes spin at different speeds about their <i>y</i>-axis.
The cubes are at the ends of a long bar that spins about its <i>z</i>-axis.
The cubes are parented to the bar, so that they are carried along by its
rotation.  In order to get the continuous spinning at a constant speed,
I used the techniques for rotational motion described in Section&nbsp;14,
in the subsection on "Animation and F-Curves".  Here is the animation:</p>

<p align=center>
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
        <source src="images/14/cube-spin.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="images/14/cube-spin.ogg" type="video/ogg">
      <b style="color:red">Sorry, but your browser does not support the video tag.</b>
</video> 
</p>

<p class="np">And here is the HTML tag that was used to embed the animation on the web page:</p>

<pre>
&lt;video width="320" height="240" controls&gt;
    &lt;source src="images/14/cube-spin.ogg" type="video/ogg"&gt;
    &lt;source src="images/14/cube-spin.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
  &lt;b style="color:red"&gt;Sorry, but your browser does not support the video tag.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/video> 
</pre>

<p class="np">Two &lt;source&gt; tags are required since there is no single
format that will work on all major browsers.  The first version, <i class="nb">cube-spin.ogg</i>,
was created in Blender using the "Ogg&nbsp;Theora" format, a patent-free and open video
format.  It should work on Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.  The second version, <i class="nb">cube-spin.mp3</i>,
was saved in H.264 format, with MPEG-4 encoding.  I should work on Internet Explorer and Safari, and
it would also be accepted by Chrome.  (This information comes from
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp">w3schools.com</a>.)</p>

<p>The two animation files were each about one-half of a megabyte in size, for a 240-frame animation
at 320-by-240 pixels.</p>
