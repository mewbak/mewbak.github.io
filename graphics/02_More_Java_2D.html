<h2>Section 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; More Java 2D Graphics</h2>

<p>Transforms are only one example of the advanced graphics capabilities that
were introduced with the <span class="classname">Graphics2D</span> class.  Others
include translucent colors, textures and gradients, wide lines, dotted and dashed lines,
antialiasing, and the ability to draw using real-number coordinates.  In this section,
we look at some of these features, especially those that are most relevant to
computer graphics more generally.</p>


<div class="subsection">
<h3>Antialiasing</h3>
<p><span class="newword">Aliasing</span> is a problem for
raster-type graphics in general, caused by the fact that raster images are made up
of small, solid-colored pixels.  It is not possible to draw geometrically perfect 
pictures by coloring pixels.  A diagonal geometric line, for example, will cover some
pixels only partially, and it is not possible to make a pixel half black and half white.
When you try to draw a line with black and white pixels only, the result is a jagged
staircase effect.  This effect is an example of aliasing.  Aliasing can also be seen
in the outlines of characters drawn on the screen and in diagonal or curved boundaries between
any two regions of different color.  (The term aliasing likely comes from the fact that
most pictures are naturally described in real-number coordinates.  When you try to represent
the image using pixels, many real-number coordinates will map to the same integer
pixel coordinates; they can all be considered as different names or "aliases" for the
same pixel.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="newword">Antialiasing</span> is a term for techniques that are designed to
mitigate the effects of aliasing.  The idea is that when a pixel is only partially
covered by a shape, the color of the pixel should be a mixture of the color of the
shape and the color of the background.  When drawing a black line on a white background,
the color of a partially covered pixel would be gray, with the shade of gray depending
on the fraction of the pixel that is covered by the line.  (In practice, calculating this
area exactly for each pixel would be too difficult, so some approximate method is used.)
Here, for example, are two lines, greatly magnified so that you can see the
individual pixels.  The one on the right is drawn using antialiasing, while the one on the 
left is not:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="images/02/Antialiasing.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="center" alt=""></p>

<p class="np">Note that antialiasing does not give a perfect image, but it can reduce the
"jaggies" that are caused by aliasing.</p>

<p>You can turn on antialiasing in a <span class="classname">Graphics2D</span>, and doing so is
generally a good idea.  To do so, simply call</p>

<pre>g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING,
                             RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);</pre>

<p class="np">where <i>g2</i> is the <span class="classname">Graphics2D</span> drawing context.
This causes subsequently drawn shapes to be antialiased.
Antialiasing can be applied to lines, to text, and to the curved shapes such as ellipses.
Note that turning on antialiasing is considered to be a "hint," which means that its exact 
effect is not guaranteed.  In general, though, it does give an improved image.
Turning antialiasing on does slow down the drawing process, and the slow-down might
be noticeable when drawing a complex image.

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Real-number Coordinates, Shapes, and Paths</h3>

<p>Drawing in the <span class="classname">Graphics</span> class is done using
integer coordinates, with the measurement given in pixels.  This works well in
the standard coordinate system.  However, once we have the ability to apply coordinate
transformations, it no longer makes sense, since the unit of measure in a transformed
coordinate system will not be equal to a pixel.  One unit of length might cover many
pixels or a small fraction of a pixel.  The solution is to use real-number coordinates
for drawing.</p>

<p>In Java, the package <span class="classname">java.awt.geom</span> provides
support for shapes defined using real number coordinates.  For example, the
class <span class="classname">Line2D</span> in that package represents line segments
whose endpoints are given as pairs of real numbers.  (Although the older drawing
methods such as <i>drawLine</i> use integer coordinates, it's important to note that
any shapes drawn using these methods are subject to the same transformation
as shapes such as <span class="classname">Line2Ds</span> that are specified with real
number coordinates. For example, drawing a line with <i>g.drawLine</i>(1,2,5,7)
will have the same effect as drawing a <span class="classname">Line2D</span> that
has endpoints (1.0,2.0) and (5.0,7.0).  In fact, all drawing is affected by
the transformation of coordinates, even, somewhat disturbingly, the width of lines
and the size of characters in a string.)
</p>

<p>Java has two primitive real number types: <span class="ptype">double</span> and <span class="ptype">float</span>.
The <span class="ptype">double</span> type can represent a larger range of numbers, with a greater
number of significant digits, than <span class="ptype">float</span>, and <span class="ptype">double</span> is the
more commonly used type.  In fact, <span class="ptype">doubles</span> are simply easier to use in Java.
However, <span class="ptype">float</span>  values generally have enough accuracy
for graphics applications, and they have the advantage of taking up less space in memory.
Furthermore, computer graphics hardware often uses float values internally.
</p>

<p>So, given
these considerations, the <span class="classname">java.awt.geom</span> package actually provides
two versions of each shape, one using coordinates of type <span class="ptype">float</span> and
one using coordinates of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  This is done in a rather strange way.
Taking <span class="classname">Line2D</span> as an example, the class <span class="classname">Line2D</span>
itself is an abstract class.  It has two subclasses, one that represents lines using
<span class="ptype">float</span> coordinates and one using <span class="ptype">double</span> coordinates.
The strangest part is that these subclasses are defined as static nested classes
inside <span class="classname">Line2D</span>: <span class="classname">Line2D.Float</span> and
<span class="classname">Line2D.Double</span>.  This means that you can declare a variable of
type <span class="classname">Line2D</span>, but to create an object, you need to use
<span class="classname">Line2D.Double</span> or <span class="classname">Line2D.Float</span>:
</p>

<pre>Line2D line1 = new Line2D.Double(1,2,5,7); // Line from (1.0,2.0) to (5.0,7.0)
Line2D line2 = new Line2D.Float(2.7F,3.1F,1.5F,7.1F); // (2.7,3.1) to (1.5,7.1)</pre>

<p class="np">For simplicity, you might want to stick to one of the types
<span class="classname">Line2D.Double</span>
or <span class="classname">Line2D.Float</span>, treating it as a basic type.
<span class="classname">Line2D.Double</span>
will be more convenient to use.  <span class="classname">Line2D.Float</span> might give better
performance, especially if you also use variables of type <span class="ptype">float</span> to avoid
type-casting.</p>

<hr class="break">

<p>Let's take a look at some of the classes in package <span class="classname">java.awt.geom</span>.
I will discuss only some of their properties; see the API documentation for more information.
The abstract class <span class="classname">Point2D</span>&mdash;and its concrete subclasses 
<span class="classname">Point2D.Double</span> and <span class="classname">Point2D.Float</span>&mdash;represents
a point in two dimensions, specified by two real number coordinates.  A point can be
constructed from two real numbers ("<span class="code">new Point2D.Double(1.2,3.7)</span>").  If <i>p</i>
is a variable of type <span class="classname">Point2D</span>, you can use <i>p.getX</i>() and
<i>p.getY</i>() to retrieve its coordinates, and you can use <i>p.setX</i>(<i>x</i>),
<i>p.setY</i>(<i>y</i>), or <i>p.setLocation</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) to set its coordinates.
If <i>pd</i> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Point2D.Double</span>, you can also refer
directly to the coordinates as <i>pd.x</i> and <i>pd.y</i>
(and similarly for <span class="classname">Point2D.Float</span>).
Other classes in <span class="classname">java.awt.geom</span> offer a similar variety of ways
to manipulate their properties, and I won't try to list them all here.
</p>

<p>In addition to <span class="classname">Point2D</span>, <span class="classname">java.awt.geom</span>
contains a variety of classes that represent geometric shapes, including  <span class="classname">Line2D</span>,
<span class="classname">Rectangle2D</span>, <span class="classname">RoundRectangle2D</span>,
<span class="classname">Ellipse2D</span>, <span class="classname">Arc2D</span>,
and <span class="classname">Path2D</span>.
All of these are abstract classes, and each of them contains a pair of subclasses such as
<span class="classname">Rectangle2D.Double</span> and <span class="classname">Rectangle2D.Float</span>.
Each of these classes implements the interface <span class="classname">java.awt.Shape</span>, which
represents the general idea of a geometric shape.  Some shapes, such as rectangles, have
<span class="newword">interiors</span> that can be <span class="newword">filled</span>; such shapes also have
outlines that can be <span class="newword">stroked</span>.  Some shapes, such as lines, are purely one-dimensional
and can only be stroked.</p>

<p>Aside from lines, rectangles are probably the simplest shapes.  A <span class="classname">Rectangle2D</span>
has a corner point (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>), a <i>width</i>, and a <i>height</i>, and
can be constructed from that data ("<span class="code">new&nbsp;Rectangle2D.Double(x,y,w,h)</span>").  The corner point
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) specify the minimum <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-values in the rectangle.
For the usual pixel coordinate
system, (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) is the upper left corner.  However, in a coordinate system in which the
minimum value of <i>y</i> is at the bottom, (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) would be the lower left corner.
The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes.  A variable
<i>r</i> of type <span class="classname">Rectangle2D.Double</span>
or <span class="classname">Rectangle2D.Float</span>
has public instance variables <i>r.x</i>, <i>r.y</i>, <i>r.width</i>, and <i>r.height</i>.
If the width or the height is less than or equal to zero, nothing will be drawn when the rectangle
is filled or stroked.   A common task is to define a rectangle by two corner points (<i>x1</i>,<i>y1</i>)
and (<i>x2</i>,<i>y2</i>).  This can be accomplished by creating a rectangle with height and width
equal to zero and then <i>adding</i> the second point to the rectangle.
Adding a point to a rectangle causes the rectangle to grow just enough to include that point:
</p>

<pre>Rectangle2D.Double r = new Rectangle2D.Double(x1,y1,0,0);
r.add(x2,y2);</pre>


<p>The classes <span class="classname">Line2D</span>,
<span class="classname">Ellipse2D</span>, <span class="classname">RoundRectangle2D</span>
and <span class="classname">Arc2D</span> create other basic shapes and work similarly
to <span class="classname">Rectangle2D</span>.  <span class="classname">Path2D</span> is more
interesting; I will discuss it below.</p>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Paints and Textures</h3>
<p>Originally, Java could draw only with basic, solid colors.  With <span class="classname">Graphics2D</span>,
Java introduced the more general idea of <span class="newword">paint</span>.  A paint can be used both
to stroke and to fill shapes. An object of type <span class="classname">Paint</span>
is used to assign color to each pixel that is "hit" by a drawing operation.
<span class="classname">Paint</span> is an <span class="code">interface</span>,
and the <span class="classname">Color</span>
class implements the <span class="classname">Paint</span> interface.  When a color is used
for painting, it applies the same color to every pixel that is hit.
However, there are other types of paint where the color that is applied to
a pixel depends on the coordinates of that pixel.  Standard Java includes several
classes that define paint with this property: <span class="classname">TexturePaint</span>
and three gradient paint classes.  In a <span class="newword">gradient</span>,
the color that is applied to pixels changes gradually from one color to anotehr
as you move from point to point.  In a <span class="newword">texture</span>,
the pixel colors come from an image, which is repeated, if necessary, like a wallpaper pattern
to cover the entire <i>xy</i>-plane.  To use a paint for drawing, you can call
<i>g2.setPaint</i>(<i>paint</i>), where <i>g2</i> is of type <span class="classname">Graphics2D.</span></p>

<p>Here, we look briefly at <span class="classname">TexturePaint</span>.  Textures are an important
concept in computer graphics.  The 2D version is fairly simple, compared to their use in 3D, but
understanding 2D textures is good preparation for 3D.  The main point is that it's not enough
to say that you are drawing with an image; you have to say how coordinates in the image will map
to drawing coordinates in the display.  In Java 2D, you do this by specifying a rectangle in
display coordinates that holds one copy of the image. You can do this in the constructor:</p>

<pre>TexturePaint paint = new TexturePaint( image, rect );  
</pre>

<p class="np">where <i>image</i> is the <span class="classname">BufferedImage</span> that will be
used for drawing, and <i>rect</i> is a <span class="classname">Rectangle2D</span> that specifies the
display rectangle that will hold one copy of the image.  Outside that rectangle, the image is
repeated horizontally and vertically.  Here for example is a polygon filled with two texture
paints, both made from the same small image of a smiley face using two different rectangles:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/02/TexturePaint.png" width="522" height="237"></p>

<p class="np">For the polygon on the left, the paint object was created using</p>

<pre>TexturePaint paint = new TexturePaint( smiley,
                new Rectangle2D.Double( 0, 0, smiley.getWidth(), smiley.getHeight() ) );
g2.setPaint(paint);
</pre>

<p class="np">For the polygon on the right, the same image was used, but the width and
height of the rectangle were twice the widht and height of the image, giving a different mapping from
the image onto the dispaly.</p>

</div>



<div class="subsection">
<h3>Paths and Bezier Curves</h3>

<p>In addition to basic shapes such as lines and rectangles, Java allows you to
create arbitrary shapes out of lines and curves.  The class <span class="classname">Path2D</span>
represents such shapes.</p>

<p>A <span class="classname">Path2D</span> <i>p</i> is empty when it is first created
("<span class="code">p&nbsp;= new&nbsp;Path2D.Double()</span>").
You can then construct the path by moving an imaginary "pen" along the path that you want to create.
The method <i>p.moveTo</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) moves the pen to the point (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) without
drawing anything.  It is used to specify the initial point of the path or
the starting point of a new piece of the path.  (A path can consist of several disconnected pieces.)
The method <i>p.lineTo</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) draws a line
from the current pen position to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>), leaving the pen at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>).
The method <i>p.close</i>() can be used to close the path (or the current piece of the path) 
by drawing a line back to its starting point.  (Note that paths don't have to be closed.)
For example, the following code creates a triangle with vertices at (0,5), (2,&minus;3), and (&minus;4,1):
</p>

<pre>Path2D p = new Path2D.Double();
p.moveTo(0,5);
p.lineTo(2,-3);
p.lineTo(-4,1);
p.close();
</pre>

<p>The segments of a path don't have to be lines; they can also be <span class="newword">Bezier curves</span>.
Two kinds of Bezier curve are allowed, quadratic and cubic.  A quadratic Bezier is defined by
quadratic polynomials, while a cubic Bezier curve is defined by cubic polynomials.  The cubic
version gives more control over the shape of the curve and so is the one that is used
most frequently.
</p>

<p>For a Bezier curve segment, you have to specify more than just the endpoints of the curve.  You also
have to specify <span class="newword">control points</span>.  Control points don't lie on the curve, but
they determine the velocity or tangent of the curve at the endpoints.  A quadratic Bezier curve segment
has one control point.  You can add a quadratic curve segment to a <span class="classname">Path2D</span> <i>p</i> using
the method <i>p.quadTo</i>(<i>cx</i>,<i>cy</i>,<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>).  The quadratic curve has
endpoints at the current pen position and at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>), with control point (<i>cx</i>,<i>cy</i>).
As the curve leaves the current pen position, it heads in the direction of (<i>cx</i>,<i>cy</i>), with a
speed determined by the distance between the pen position and (<i>cx</i>,<i>cy</i>).  Similarly,
the curve heads into the point (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) from the direction of (<i>cx</i>,<i>cy</i>), with a speed determined
by the distance from (<i>cx</i>,<i>cy</i>) to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>).  Note that the control point
(<i>cx</i>,<i>cy</i>) is <b>not</b> on the curve&mdash;it just controls the direction of the
curve.  A cubic Bezier curve is similar, except that it has two control points.  The first
controls the velocity of the curve as it leaves the initial endpoint of the curve, and the
second controls the velocity as it arrives at the final endpoint of the curve.  You can
add a Bezier curve to a <span class="classname">Path2D</span> <i>p</i> with the method
</p>

<pre>p.curveTo( cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2, x, y )
</pre>

<p class="np">This adds a Bezier curve that starts at the current pen position and ends at
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>), using (<i>cx1</i>,<i>cy1</i>) and (<i>cx2</i>,<i>cy2</i>) as
control points.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of Bezier curves, you can
try <a href="canvas/bezier.html">this&nbsp;live&nbsp;demo</a>, which allows you to experiment
with Bezier curves by dragging their endpoints and control points.  Here is a picture from that demo:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/02/bezier.png" style="border: thin solid black" height="476" width="523"></p>

<p class="np">This shows a path made up of three cubic Bezier curve segmement.  The segments are drawn
in black, with the endpoints shown as black dots.  The control points are shown as blue squares.  Note how
the tangents to the curve are determined by the positions of the control points.</p>
