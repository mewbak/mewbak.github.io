<h2>Section 10:&nbsp;&nbsp; Textures</h2>

<p>Uniformly colored 3D objects  look nice enough, but they are a little
bland.  Their uniform colors don't have the visual appeal of, say, a brick wall or a plaid couch. 
Three-dimensional objects can be made to look more interesting and more realistic by adding
a <span class="newword">texture</span> to their surfaces.  A texture&mdash;or at least the kind of texture
that we consider here&mdash;is a 2D image that can be applied to the surface of a 3D object.
Here is a picture  that shows six objects with various textures:

or <i class="nb">opengl-c</i> folder.)</p>

<p>Textures might be the most complicated part of OpenGL, and they are a part that has survived,
and become more complicated,
in the most modern versions since they are so vital for the efficient creation of realistic
images.  This section covers only part of the OpenGL texture API.  It also shows how to
load images from files into OpenGL both in C and in JOGL.</p>



<div class="subsection">
    
<h3>Texture Coordinates</h3>

<p>When a texture is applied to a surface, each point on the surface has to correspond to a point
in the texture.  There has to be a way to determine how this mapping is computed.  For that,
the object needs <span class="newword">texture coordinates</span>.   As is generally the
case in OpenGL, texture coordinates are specified for each vertex of a primitive.  Texture
coordinates for points inside the primitive are calculated by interpolating the values
from the vertices of the primitive.</p>

<p>A texture image comes
with its own 2D coordinate system.  Traditionally, <i>s</i> used for the horizontal
coordinate on the image and <i>t</i> is used for the vertical coordinate.  <i>s</i>&nbsp;is
a real-number coordinate that ranges from 0 on the left of the image to 1 on the
right, while <i>t</i> ranges from 0 at the bottom to 1 at the top.  Values of <i>s</i>
or <i>t</i> outside of the range 0 to 1 are not inside the image.
</p>

<p>The texture coordinates for a vertex are a pair of numbers (<i>s,t</i>) that tell which
point in the image is mapped to that vertex.  For example, suppose that we
want to apply part of an <i>EarthAtNight</i> image to a triangle. Let's say that  the area
in the image that is to be mapped onto the triangular primitive is the triangle shown here outlined in thick orange:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="images/10/texcoords.png" width="595" height="329" ></p>

<p class="np">The vertices of this area have (<i>s,t</i>) coordinates (0.3,0.05), (0.45,0.6), and
(0.25,0.7).  These coordinates in the image, expressed in terms of <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>,
are the texture coordinates that will be mapped to the vertices of the triangular primitive.
When I generate the vertices of that primitive,
I have to specify the corresponding texture coordinates in the image.
This is done by calling <i>glTexCoord2d</i>(<i>s,t</i>).  (Or you can
use <i>glTexCoord2f</i>.)  You can call this method just before generating the vertex.
Usually, every vertex of a polygon will have different texture coordinates.
To draw the triangle in this case, I could say:
</p>

<pre>glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
glNormal3d(0,0,1);
glTexCoord2d(0.3,0.05);  // Texture coords for vertex (0,0)
glVertex2d(0,0);
glTexCoord2d(0.45,0.6);  // Texture coords for vertex (0,1)
glVertex2d(0,1);
glTexCoord2d(0.25,0.7);  // Texture coords for vertex (1,0)
glVertex2d(1,0);
glEnd();</pre>

<p class="np">Note that there is no particular relationship between the (<i>x,y</i>) 
coordinates of a vertex, which give its position in space, and the (<i>s,t</i>)
texture coordinate associated with the vertex, which tell what point in the image
is mapped to the vertex.  In fact, in this case, the triangle that I am drawing has
a different shape from the triangular area in the image, and that piece of the
image will have to be stretched and distorted to fit.
</p>

<p>Note that texture coordinates are attributes of vertices.  When you specify
a vertex with <i>glVertex*</i>, the current texture coordinates are copied and become
attributes associated with the vertex.
</p>

<p>Sometimes, it's difficult to decide what texture coordinates to use.  One case where it's
easy is applying the complete texture to a rectangle.   Here is a code segment that draws
a square in the <i>xy</i>-plane, with appropriate texture coordinates to map
the entire image onto the square:
</p>

<pre>
glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE_FAN);
glNormal3f(0,0,1);
glTexCoord2d(0,0);     // Texture coords for lower left corner
glVertex2d(-0.5,-0.5);
glTexCoord2d(1,0);     // Texture coords for lower right corner
glVertex2d(0.5,-0.5);
glTexCoord2d(1,1);     // Texture coords for upper right corner
glVertex2d(0.5,0.5);
glTexCoord2d(0,1);     // Texture coords for upper left corner
glVertex2d(-0.5,0.5);
glEnd();
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the standard shapes in the GLUT library do not come with texture coordinates
(except for the teapot, which does).  You will be relieved to know that I have written a set of
functions for drawing similar shapes that do come with texture coordinates.  The functions
can be found in <a href="opengl-jogl/TexturedShapes.java">TexturedShapes.java</a> for JOGL
or in <a href="opengl-c/textured-shapes.c">textured-shapes.c</a> for&nbsp;C.
Of course, there
are many ways of applying a texture to a given object, and when you use my functions, you are
stuck with my decision about how to do so.
The objects are drawn with a variety of textures in the JOGL program
<a href="opengl-jogl/TextureDemo.java">TextureDemo.java</a> and in the C program
<a href="opengl-c/texture-demo.c">texture-demo.c</a>.</p>


<p>One last question: What happens if you supply texture coordinates that
are not in the range from 0 to 1?  It turns out that such values are legal,
but the default behavior, which is to extend the colors from the edges of
the texture image to fill the rest of the <i>st</i>-plane, is not very
desirable.  I will tell you how to change this behavior in the next subsection.</p>

</div>


<div class="subsection">
<h3>Texture Targets and Texture Parameters</h3>

<p>OpenGL can actually use one-dimensional and three-dimensional textures, as well as
two-dimensional.  Because of this, many OpenGL functions dealing with textures
take a <span class="newword">texture&nbsp;target</span> as a parameter, to tell whether
the function should be applied to one, two, or three dimensional textures.  For us,
the only texture target will be <i>GL_TEXTURE_2D</i>.</p>

<p>There are a number of options that apply to textures, to control the details of how
textures are applied to surfaces. Some of the options can be set using the
<i>glTexParameteri</i>() function.  Here are two examples:</p>

<pre>glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_REPEAT);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_REPEAT);
</pre>

<p class="np">The first parameter to this function is the texture target, the second
is the name of the parameter that is being set, and the third is the value of the parameter.
The properties <i>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S</i> and <i>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T</i> tell how
OpenGL treats texture coordinates outside of the range 0.0 to 1.0.  The value <i>GL_REPEAT</i>
tells OpenGL to repeat the texture  over and over to fill the entire plane, so that
using <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> values outside the usual range will simply cause
the texture to be repeated.  With this setting of the parameters, for example, if you supply texture coordinates
(0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0) for the four vertices of a square, then the
square will be covered with four copies of the texture.  For a repeating 
texture, such as a brick wall image, this can be much more effective than
stretching a single copy of the image to cover the entire square.  This
behavior is not the default, and you will almost always want to use two commands given
above to get the repeating texture behavior.</p>



</div>




<div class="subsection">
<h3>About MipMaps and Filtering</h3>

<p>When a texture is applied to a surface, the pixels in the texture
do not usually match up one-to-one with pixels on the surface,
and in general, the texture must be stretched or shrunk as it
is being mapped onto the surface.  Sometimes, several pixels in
the texture will be mapped to the same pixel on the surface.  In this case,
the color that is applied to the surface pixel must somehow be computed
from the colors of all the texture pixels that map to it.
This is an example of <span class="newword">filtering</span>; in particular,
it is "minification filtering" because the texture is being shrunk.
When one pixel from the texture covers more than one pixel on the
surface, the texture has to be magnified, and we have an example
of "magnification filtering."</p>

<p>One bit of terminology before we proceed:  The pixels in a texture are referred to
as <span class="newword">texels</span>, short for texture pixels, and I will use
that term from now on.</p>

<p>When deciding how to apply a texture to a point on a surface,
OpenGL has the texture coordinates for that point.  Those texture
coordinates correspond to one point in the texture, and that point
lies in one of the texture's texels.  The easiest thing to do
is to apply the color of that texel to the point on the surface.
This is called <span class="newword">nearest neighbor filtering</span>.
It is very fast, but it does not usually give good results.
It doesn't take into account the difference in size between the
pixels on the surface and the texels.  An improvement on nearest neighbor
filtering is <span class="newword">linear filtering</span>, which can take an average of
several texel colors to compute the color that will be applied to
the surface.</p>

<p>The problem with linear filtering is that it will be very inefficient
when a large texture is applied to a much smaller surface area.  In this
case, many texels map to one pixel, and computing the average of so
many texels becomes very inefficient.  OpenGL has a neat solution for
this:  <span class="newword">mipmaps</span>.</p>

<p>A mipmap for a texture is a scaled-down version of that texture.
A complete set of mipmaps consists of the full-size texture, a half-size
version in which each dimension is divided by two,
a quarter-sized version, a one-eighth-sized version, and so on.
If one dimension shrinks to a single pixel, it is not reduced further,
but the other dimension will continue to be cut in half until it
too reaches one pixel.  In any case, the final mipmap consists of
a single pixel.  Here are the first few images in the set of mipmaps for a brick
texture:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="images/10/mipmaps.png" width="331" height="141"></p>

<p>You'll notice that the mipmaps become small very quickly.  The total
memory used by a set of mipmaps is only about one-third more than the
memory used for the original texture, so the additional memory requirement 
is not a big issue when using mipmaps.</p>

<p>Mipmaps are used only for minification filtering.  They
are essentially a way of pre-computing the bulk of the averaging
that is required when shrinking a texture to fit a surface.  To texture a pixel,
OpenGL can first select the mipmap whose texels most closely match the
size of the pixel.  It can then do linear filtering on that mipmap
to compute a color, and it will have to average at most a few texels 
in order to do so.</p>

<p>In newer versions of OpenGL, you can get OpenGL to generate mipmaps
automatically.  In earlier versions, if you want to
use mipmaps, you must either load each mipmap individually, or you must
generate them yourself.  (The GLU library has a method, <i>gluBuild2DMipmaps</i>
that can be used to generate a set of mipmaps for a 2D texture.)  However, my sample
programs do not use mipmaps.</p>

<hr class="break">

<p>OpenGL supports several different filtering techniques for minification
and magnification.  The filters can be set with
<i>glTexParameteri</i>():</p>

<pre>glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, magFilter);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, minFilter);</pre>

<p class="np">where <i>magFilter</i> and <i>minFilter</i> are constants that specify the
filtering algorithm.  For the <i>magFilter</i>, the only options are 
<i>GL_NEAREST</i> and <i>GL_LINEAR</i>, giving nearest neighbor and
linear filtering.  The default for the MAG filter is <i>GL_LINEAR</i>, and
there is rarely any need to change it.  For <i>minFilter</i>, in addition
to <i>GL_NEAREST</i> and <i>GL_LINEAR</i>, there are four options that
use mipmaps for more efficient filtering.  The default MIN filter
is <i>GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR</i>, which does averaging between
mipmaps and nearest neighbor filtering within each mipmap.  For even 
better results, at the cost of greater inefficiency, you can use
<i>GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR</i>, which does averaging both between and
within mipmaps.  (You can research the remaining two options on your
own if you are curious.)
</p>


<p><b>One very important note:</b>  If you are <b>not</b> using mipmaps for a texture,
it is imperative that you change the minification filter for that texture
to <i>GL_NEAREST</i> or, more likely, <i>GL_LINEAR</i>.
The default MIN filter <b>requires</b> mipmaps, and if mipmaps are not available, then
the texture is considered to be improperly formed, and OpenGL ignores it!
Remember that if you don't create mipmaps and if you don't change the minification
filter, then your texture will simply be ignored by OpenGL!
</p>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Texture Transformation</h3>

<p>Recall that textures are applied to objects using texture coordinates.
The texture coordinates for a vertex determine which point in a texture is mapped
to that vertex.  Textures are most often images, which are two-dimensional,
and the two coordinates on a texture image are referred to as <i>s</i> and
<i>t</i>.  Since OpenGL also supports one-dimensional textures and 
three-dimensional textures, texture coordinates cannot be restricted to
two coordinates.  In fact, a set of texture coordinates in OpenGL is
represented internally in the form of homogeneous coordinates,
which are referred to as (<i>s</i>,<i>t</i>,<i>r</i>,<i>q</i>).  We have
used <i>glTexCoord2d</i> to specify texture <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> coordinates, but a call to
<i>glTexCoord2d</i>(<i>s</i>,<i>t</i>) is really just shorthand for
<i>glTexCoord4d</i>(<i>s</i>,<i>t</i>,0,1).</p>

<p>Since texture coordinates are no different from vertex coordinates, they can
be transformed in exactly the same way.  OpenGL maintains a <span class="newword">texture transformation
matrix</span> as part of its state, along with the modelview matrix and projection
matrix.  When a texture is applied to an object, the texture coordinates that were
specified for its vertices are transformed by the texture matrix.  The transformed
texture coordinates are then used to pick out a point in the texture.  Of course, the
default texture transform is the identity, which has no effect.</p>

<p>The texture matrix can represent scaling, rotation, translation and combinations
of these basic transforms.  To specify a texture transform, you have to use
<i>glMatrixMode</i>() to set the matrix mode to <i>GL_TEXTURE</i>.  With this mode in
effect, calls to methods such as <i>glRotate*</i>, <i>glScale*</i>, and <i>glLoadIdentity</i>
are applied to the texture matrix.  For example to install a texture transform that scales
texture coordinates by a factor of two in each direction, you could say:
</p>

<pre>glMatrixMode(GL_TEXTURE);
glLoadIdentity(); // Make sure we are starting from the identity matrix.
glScalef(2,2,2);
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); // Leave matrix mode set to GL_MODELVIEW. 
</pre>

<p>Now, what does this actually mean for the appearance of the texture on a surface?
This scaling transforms multiplies each texture coordinate by 2.  For example, if a
vertex was assigned 2D texture coordinates (0.4,0.1), then that vertex will be mapped,
after the texture transform is applied, to the point (<i>s</i>,<i>t</i>) = (0.8,0.2)
in the texture.  The texture coordinates vary <i>twice as fast</i> on the surface
as they would without the scaling transform.  A region on the surface that would map
to a 1-by-1 square in the texture image without the transform will instead map
to a 2-by-2 square in the image&mdash;so that a larger piece of the image will be
seen inside the region.  In other words, the texture image will be <i>shrunk</i> by
a factor of two on the surface!  More generally, the effect of a texture transformation
on the appearance of the texture is the <b>inverse</b> of its effect on the texture
coordinates.  (This is exactly analogous to the inverse relationship between a viewing
transformation and a modeling transformation.)  If the texture transform is translation to
the right, then the texture moves to the left on the surface.  If the texture transform
is a counterclockwise rotation, then the texture rotates clockwise on the surface.
</p>

<p>I mention texture transforms here mostly to show how OpenGL can use transformations
in another context.  But it is sometimes useful to transform a texture to make it fit
better on a surface.  And for an unusual effect, you might even animate the texture transform
to make the texture image move on the surface.
</p>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Using Textures in C</h3>

<p>It's about time that we looked at the process of actually using an image
as a texture.  The whole process is different enough in C and in
JOGL that I will discuss the two languages separately, starting with&nbsp;C.
In the most common case, the image
that you want to use as a texture is in a file.  OpenGL, however, does not
have functions for loading images from a file, so you need some other means
to get the image data from the file into the computer's memory.  Once you
have the image is in memory, there is an OpenGL function that you can use to load the
image data into a texture. </p>

<p>The OpenGL function for loading image data from the computer's
memory into a 2D texture is <i>glTexImage2D</i>(), which takes the form:</p>

<pre>glTexImage2D(target, mipmapLevel, internalFormat, width, height, border,
                            format, dataType, pixels);</pre>

<p class="np">The <i>target</i> should be <i>GL_TEXTURE_2D</i>.  The <i>mipmapLevel</i>
should ordinarily be&nbsp;0. It is used when you want to load individual mipmaps for a
texture, and the value 0 means that you are loading the main texture.  The
<i>internalFormat</i> says how the texture data is to be stored in OpenGL texture
memory. It is ordinarily <i>GL_RGB</i> to store an 8-bit red/green/blue component for
each pixel.  Another possibility is <i>GL_RGBA</i>, which adds an alpha component.
The <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> give the size of the image; the values should
usually be powers of two.  The value of <i>border</i> should be 0; the only other
possibility is 1, which indicates that a one-pixel border has been added around the
image data.  The last three parameters describe the image data.  The
<i>format</i> tells how the image data is represented in memory and is often
<i>GL_RGB</i> or <i>GL_RGBA</i>.  The <i>dataType</i> is usually <i>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</i>,
indicating that each color component is represented as a one-byte value in the
range 0 to 255.  And <i>pixels</i> is a pointer to the start of the actual
color data for the pixels.  The image data from that location will be read into
the texture, starting at the bottom left corner of the texture, filling in the
bottom row of pixels in the texture, then the row above that, and so on.
If the <i>dataType</i> is <i>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</i>, then
the number of bytes of image data must be 
3<span class="code">*</span><i>width</i><span class="code">*</span><i>height</i> for
<i>GL_RGB</i> data and 4<span class="code">*</span><i>width</i><span class="code">*</span><i>height</i>
for <i>GL_RGBA</i> data.</p>

<p>I note that the width and the height of a texture <b>must</b> be a power of two
in OpenGL 1.0.  In later versions of OpenGL, starting with version 2.0, this restriction
was relaxed, but even then power-of-two textures probably work more efficently.</p>
    
<p>This all looks rather complicated, but in practice, a call to <i>glTexImage2D</i>
generally takes the form</p>

<pre>glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, width, height, 0,
                    GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixels);</pre>

<p class="np">Calling this function will load the image into the texture,
but it does not cause the texture to be used.  For that, you also have to
call</p>

<pre>glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
</pre>

<p class="np">If you only want to use the texture on some objects, you can
enable <i>GL_TEXTURE_2D</i> before drawing objects that you want to be
textured and disable it before drawing untextured objects.  You can also change
the texture that is being used at any time by calling <i>glTexImage2D</i>.</p>

<hr class="break">

<p>The problem that remains is how to get the image data into memory before
calling glTexImage2D.  One possibility is to compute the data&mdash;you can
actually have your program generate texture data on the fly.  More likely,
however, you want to load it from a file.  To do that, you probably want to
use an image library.  Several free image libraries are available.  I will
discuss how one of them, <i>FreeImage</i>, can be used to load OpenGL textures.
FreeImage can be obtained from <a href="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/" class="nb">http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/</a>,
but I was able to use it in Linux simply by installing the package <i class="nb">libfreeimage-dev</i>.
To make it available to my program, I added <tt>#include&nbsp;"FreeImage.h"</tt> to the
top of my C program, and I added the option <tt>-lfreeimage</tt> to the <i>gcc</i> command to make
the library available to the compiler.  (See the program
<a href="opengl-c/texture-demo.c" class="nb">texture-demo.c</a> for an example that uses
this library.)  Instead of discussing FreeImage in detail, I present a
well-commented function that uses it to load image data from a file:
</p>

<pre>
void* imgPixels;  // Pointer to raw RGB data for texture.
                  // (Note:  void* is a standard C type representing
                  //  a pointer that can point to anything at all.)
int imgWidth;   // Width of the texture image.
int imgHeight;  // Height of the texture image.

void loadTexture( char* fileName ) {
        // Loads a texture image using the FreeImage library, and stores
        // the required info in global variables imgPixels, imgWidth, imgHeight.
        // The parameter fileName is a string that contains the name of the
        // image file from which the image is to be loaded.  If the
        // image can't be loaded, then imgPixels will be set to be a null pointer.
        
    imgPixels = 0; // Null pointer to signal that data has not been read.
    
    FREE_IMAGE_FORMAT format = FreeImage_GetFIFFromFilename(fileName);
         // FREE_IMAGE_FORMAT is a type defined by the FreeImage library.
         // Here, the format is determined from the file extension in
         // the file name, such as .png, .jpg, or .gif.  Many formats
         // are supported.
    
    if (format == FIF_UNKNOWN) {
        printf("Unknown file type for texture image file %s\n", fileName);
        return;
    }
    
    FIBITMAP* bitmap = FreeImage_Load(format, fileName, 0);
          // FIBITMAP is a type defined by the FreeImage library, representing
          // the raw image data plus some metadata such as width, height,
          // and the format of the image data.  This actually tries to
          // read the data from the specified file.
          
    if (!bitmap) {
        printf("Failed to load image %s\n", fileName);
        return;
    }
    
    FIBITMAP* bitmap2 = FreeImage_ConvertTo24Bits(bitmap);
          // This creates a copy of the image, with the data represented
          // in standard RGB (or BGR) format, for use with OpenGL.
    
    FreeImage_Unload(bitmap);
          // After finishing with a bitmap, it should be disposed.
          // We are finished with bitmap, but not with bitmap2, since
          // we will continue to use the data from bitmap2.
          
    imgPixels = FreeImage_GetBits(bitmap2);  // Get the data we need!
    imgWidth = FreeImage_GetWidth(bitmap2);
    imgHeight = FreeImage_GetHeight(bitmap2);
    
    if (imgPixels) {
        printf("Texture image loaded from file %s, size %dx%d\n", 
                         fileName, imgWidth, imgHeight);
    }
    else {
        printf("Failed to get texture data from %s\n", fileName);
    }
    
} // end loadTexture</pre>

<p>After this function has been called, the data that we need for
<i>glTexImage2D</i>() is in the global variables <i>imgWidth</i>,
<i>imgHeight</i>, and <i>imgPixels</i> (or <i>imgPixels</i> is 0
to indicate that the attempt to load the image failed).  There
is one complication:  FreeImage will store the color components
for a pixel in the order red/green/blue on some platforms but in
the order blue/green/red on other platforms.  The second data format
is called <i>GL_GBR</i> in OpenGL.  If you use the wrong format
in <i>glTextImage2D</i>(), then the red and blue components of the
color will be reversed.  To tell the difference, you can use
the FreeImage constant <i>FI_RGBA_RED</i>, which tells the position
of the red color component in pixel data.  This constant will be
0 if the format is <i>GL_RGB</i> and will be 2 if the format
is <i>GL_BGR</i>.  So, to use the texture in OpenGL, you might
say:</p>

<pre>
if ( imgPixels ) { // The image data exists
    int format; // The format of the color data in memory
    if ( FI_RGBA_RED == 0 )
       format = GL_RGB;
    else
       format = GL_BGR;
    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, imgWidth, imgHeight, 0, format,
                        GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, imgPixels);
    glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
}
else { // The image data was not loaded, so don't attempt to use the texture.
    glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
}
</pre>

<p>To be even more careful, you could check that the width and the height
of the image are powers of two.  If not, you can resize it using
the function <i>FreeImage_Rescale</i>() from the FreeImage library.</p>

<h3>Using Textures with JOGL</h3>

<p>JOGL comes with several classes that make it fairly easy to use textures in Java,
notably <span class="classname">Texture</span> and
<span class="classname">TextureIO</span> in package
<i>com.jogamp.opengl.util.texture</i> and
<span class="classname">AWTTextureIO</span> in package
<i>com.jogamp.opengl.util.texture.awt</i>.  For an example of using
textures with JOGL, see the program
<a href="opengl-jogl/TextureDemo.java">TextureDemo.java</a>.
</p>

<p>An object of type <span class="classname">Texture</span> represents
a texture that has already been loaded into OpenGL.  Once you have
an object, <i>texture</i>, of type <span class="classname">Texture</span>,
you just need to call</p>

<pre>texture.bind(gl);
</pre>

<p class="np">to tell OpenGL to use the texture for objects that it will
draw.  (This is roughly the equivalent of calling <i>glTexImage2D</i>() in
C, except that the texture has already been loaded and <i>texture.bind</i>()
just tells OpenGL to use it.)  Before the texture will actually be applied,
however, you still have to enable texturing by calling
<i>gl.glEnable</i>(<i>GL2.GL_TEXTURE_2D)</i> or, equivalently,</p>

<pre>texture.enable(gl);
</pre>

<p>You can set texture parameters in the usual way, by calling
<i>gl.glTexParameteri</i>(), but it is preferable to use the <span class="classname">Texture</span>
class to set the parameters, by calling</p>

<pre>texture.setTexParameteri( gl, parameterName, value );
</pre>

<p class="np">since this allows you to associate different parameter values
with different <span class="classname">Texture</span> objects.  For example,</p>

<pre>
texture.setTexParameteri( gl, GL2.GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL2.GL_REPEAT );
texture.setTexParameteri( gl, GL2.GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL2.GL_REPEAT );
</pre>

<p>So, once you have a <span class="classname">Texture</span>, it's pretty easy
to use.  But there remains the problem of creating <span class="classname">Texture</span> objects.
For that, you can use static methods in the <span class="classname">TextureIO</span>
and <span class="classname">AWTTextureIO</span> classes.  For example, if <i>fileName</i>
is the name of an image file (or a path to such a file), then you can say</p>

<pre>texture = TextureIO.newTexture( new File(fileName), true );
</pre>

<p class="np">to load a texture from the file, where <i>texture</i> is of type
<span class="classname">Texture</span>. The <i>boolean</i> parameter here, and in
all the methods we will look at, tells JOGL whether or not to create mipmaps for
the texture; by passing <i>true</i>, we automatically get a full set of mipmaps.</p>

<p><b>One important note:</b> Java's texture creation functions will only work
when an OpenGL context is "current."  This will be true in the event-handling
methods of a <span class="classname">GLEventListener</span>, including
the <i>init</i>() and <i>display</i>() methods.  However, it will <b>not</b>
be true in ordinary methods and constructors.</p>

<p>Of course, in Java, you are more likely to store the image as
a resource in the program than as a separate file.  If <i>resourceName</i> is
a path to the image resource, you can load the image into a texture with</p>

<pre>URL textureURL;
textureURL = getClass().getClassLoader().getResource( resourceName );
texture = TextureIO.newTexture(textureURL, true, null);
</pre>

<p class="np">
The third parameter to this version of <i>newTexture</i> specifies the image type
and can be given as a file suffix such as "png" or "jpg"; the value <i>null</i>
tells OpenGL to autodetect the image type, which should work in general.
(By the way, all the texture-loading code that I discuss here can throw
exceptions, which you will have to catch or otherwise handle in some way.)
</p>

<p>One problem with all this is that textures loaded in this way will be
upside down!  This happens because Java stores image data from the top row
of the image to the bottom, whereas OpenGL expects images data to be stored
starting with the bottom row.  If this is a problem for you, you can flip
the image before using it to create a texture.  To do that, you have to
load the image into a <span class="classname">BufferedImage</span> and then load that into a
texture using the <span class="classname">AWTTextureIO</span> class.
For example, assuming <i>resourceName</i> is a path to an image resource
in the program:
</p>

<pre>URL textureURL;
textureURL = getClass().getClassLoader().getResource( resourceName );
BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read( textureURL );
ImageUtil.flipImageVertically( img );
textures = AWTTextureIO.newTexture(GLProfile.getDefault(), img, true);
</pre>

<p class="np">The <span class="np">ImageUtil</span> class is defined in
package <i>com.jogamp.opengl.util.awt</i>.  Here, I obtained a
<span class="classname">BufferedImage</span> by reading it from a
resource.  You could also read it from a file or even draw it using
Java 2D graphics.</p>

<h3>Drawing Texture Images with OpenGL</h3>
<p>Texture images for use in an OpenGL program usually come from an
external source, most often an image file.  However, OpenGL is itself
a powerful engine for creating images.  Sometimes, instead of loading
an image file, it's convenient to have OpenGL create the image internally,
by rendering it.  This is possible because OpenGL can read texture
data from its own color buffer, where it does its drawing.  To
create a texture image using OpenGL, you just have to draw the
image using standard OpenGL drawing commands and then load that
image as a texture using the method</p>

<pre>glCopyTexImage2D( target, mipmapLevel, internalFormat,
                                     x, y, width, height, border );</pre>

<p class="np">In this method, <i>target</i> will be <i>GL_TEXTURE_2D</i>;
<i>mipmapLevel</i>
should be zero; the <i>internalFormat</i> will ordinarily be <i>GL_RGB</i>
or <i>GL_RGBA</i>; <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> specify
the lower left corner of the rectangle in the color buffer from
which the texture will be read and are usually 0; <i>width</i> and <i>height</i>
are the size of that rectangle; and <i>border</i> will usually be 0.
As usual with textures, the <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> should
ordinarily be powers of two.
That is, a call to <i>glCopyTexImage2D</i> will typically look like
</p>

<pre>glCopyTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, x, y, width, height, 0);
</pre>

<p class="np">The end result is that the specified rectangle from
the color buffer will be copied to texture memory and will become the
current 2D texture.  This works in the same way as a call to
<i>glTexImage2D</i>(), except for the source of the image data.</p>

<p>An example can be found in the JOGL program
<a href="opengl-jogl/TextureFromColorBuffer.java">TextureFromColorBuffer.java</a> and
in the C version <a href="opengl-c/texture-from-color-buffer.c" class="nb">texture-from-color-buffer.c</a>.
This program draws the windmill-and-cart scene
from <a href="03_Java_Hierarchical.html">Section&nbsp;3</a> and then uses that
drawing as a texture on 3D objects.  Here is an image from the program, showing the
texture on a cylinder:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/10/drawnTexture.png" width="300" height="284"></p>

<p class="np">The texture is animated!  A new texture is drawn for each frame
of the animation.  All the work is done in the display method.  In that method,
the current frame of the windmill-and-cart scene is first drawn as a 2D scene with
lighting disabled.  This picture is not shown on the computer screen; since
double-buffering is used, the drawing is done off-screen and the image
will be erased before it's ever shown on screen.  The <i>glCopyTexImage2D</i>()
function is then called to copy the
scene as the current texture.  Then, the color buffer is cleared, lighting is
enabled, and a 3D projection is set up before finally drawing the 3D object
that is seen on the computer screen.</p>
