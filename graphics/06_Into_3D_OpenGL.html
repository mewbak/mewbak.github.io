<h2>Section 6:&nbsp;&nbsp; Into 3D with OpenGL</h2>

<p>It's time to move on to 3D.  We will do this by looking at <span class="newword">OpenGL</span>, a common
and widely supported 3D graphics API.  OpenGL was introduced in 1992 and has
undergone a lot of changes recently.  In fact, we will work for now with
the original version, OpenGL&nbsp;1.0, much of which is removed from
the most modern versions, except as an optional module in some versions.  However, the
newer OpenGL standard is a difficult entry into 3D for beginners.  And
OpentGL&nbsp;1.0 is still widely supported, so it makes sense to begin
with that.</p>

<p>Currently, OpenGL is implemented in the graphics hardware of most
desktop and laptop computers.  In practice, they all support OpenGL&nbsp;1.0
as well as newer versions.  (Graphics cards can support other graphics APIs
at the same time as OpenGL, including DirectX, the standard graphics library
for Windows.)  Handheld computing devices such as smart phones
and tablets often implement <span class="newword">OpenGL&nbsp;ES</span>, a version for "embedded systems."
OpenGL&nbsp;ES&nbsp;1.0 was based on OpenGL&nbsp;1.3 and includes most of
OpenGL&nbsp;1.0.  OpenGL&nbsp;ES&nbsp;2.0 is <b>not</b> compatible with
OpengGL&nbsp;1.0.  Newer Android and iOS devices support both OpenGL&nbsp;ES&nbsp;1.0
and 2.0, while older devices only supported&nbsp;1.0.  There is also <span class="newword">WebGL</span>, which
is a technology for 3D graphics on Web pages.  It is pretty much the same as
OpenGL&nbsp;ES&nbsp;2.0, with some adaptations to the Web environment.  It is now
supported pretty well in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  Although it is not yet in Internet Explorer,
it should be included in IE&nbsp;11.
</p>

<p>OpenGL is a very low-level graphics API, similar to the 2D APIs we have
covered.  That is, it has only very basic drawing operations and no
built-in support for scene graphs or object oriented graphics.  The plan
for the rest of the course is to use old-fashioned OpenGL to learn about
3D graphics fundamentals. Then, we'll spend time on some higher-level 3D graphics
systems, more similar to what most graphics programmers and designers will
use for their work.  After that, we'll come back to OpenGL to cover its
more modern features.</p>

<p>Remember that when I say "OpenGL" for the time being, I mean "OpenGL 1.0."  OpenGL&nbsp;1.0
is a large API, and I will only cover a small part of it.  The goal is to introduce 3D graphics concepts,
not to fully cover the API.</p>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Introduction to OpenGL and 3D Drawing</h3>

<p>OpenGL consists of a large number of subroutines.  It also comes with a large number of
named constants for use in subroutine calls.  The API is defined in the C programming language,
but there are "bindings" for many other languages that make it possible to use OpenGL from
those languages.  For example, the OpenGL binding for Java is called <span class="newword">JOGL</span>.
In this section, I will use the C API; I will introduce JOGL in the next section.  I&nbsp;also
note here that OpenGL is purely an API for drawing.  It includes nothing about creating windows in which
to draw or interacting with the user; again, that is something we will deal with in the next
section.  For now, we limit discussion to drawing with the OpenGL&nbsp;1.0 API.
</p>

<p>In a two dimensional coordinate system, points are given by a pair of coordinates,
conventionally called <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>,
and there are two coordinate axes, the <i>x</i>-axis and the <i>y</i>-axis.
In three dimensions, you need three coordinates to specify a point.  The third coordinate
is usually called <i>z</i>, and the third dimension is represented by a third axis,
the <span class="newword"><i>z</i>-axis</span>, which is perpendicular to both
the <i>x</i>-axis and the <i>y</i>-axis.  All three axes intersect at the point (0,0,0),
which is called the <span class="newword">origin</span>.  In the usual OpenGL setup,
the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>-axes lie on the viewing surface (such as your computer screen).
The positive direction of the <i>x</i>-axis points to the right, and the positive
direction of the <i>y</i>-axis points upward (not down, as in the Java and Canvas APIs).
The <i>z</i>-axis is perpendicular to the screen.  The positive direction of the
<i>z</i>-axis points outward from the screen, towards the viewer, and the negative
direction extends behind the screen.</p>

<p>In the default coordinate system, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> are all limited
to the range &minus;1&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.  Anything drawn inside this cube is
<span class="newword">projected</span> onto the two-dimensional drawing surface
for viewing.  Anything drawn outside the cube is <span class="newword">clipped</span>
and does not appear in the displayed 2D image.  The projection is done, by default,
by simply discarding the <i>z</i>-coordinate.  Of course, all of these defaults can
be changed, as we will see.  (Saying that the <i>z</i>-axis points out of the screen
by default is a little misleading.  The truth, which you
should probably ignore, is that the actual default
coordinate system&mdash;the one that you get if you make no changes at all&mdash;is
a left-handed system with positive z pointing into the screen.  However, the conventional
way to set up a non-default projection includes a <i>z</i>-axis flip that changes the coordinate
system to right-handed, and OpenGL programmers think in terms of a right-handed
system.)</p>

<p>OpenGL can draw only points, lines, and triangles.  Anything else has to built up
out of these very simple shapes.  (Actually, OpenGL&nbsp;1.0 can also draw quadrilaterals
and polygons, but they are easy to construct from triangles and have been dropped from
modern OpenGL, so I ignore them here.)  Let's jump right in and see how to
draw a triangle:</p>

<pre>
glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
glVertex3f(1,0,0);
glVertex3f(0,1,0);
glVertex3f(0,0,1);
glEnd();
</pre>

<p class="np">This draws the triangle with vertices at the 3D points
(1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1).
There is already a lot here to talk about.  A shape is drawn by specifying
a sequence of <span class="newword">vertices</span> between calls to
<i>glBegin</i>() and <i>glEnd</i>().  The parameter to <i>glBegin</i>() is a
constant that tell what kind of shape to draw.  In OpenGL terms, the parameter
specifies which <span class="newword">primitive</span> to draw.
Note that <i>GL_TRIANGLES</i> is plural.  It can be used to draw
several triangles with one <i>glBegin/glEnd</i>.  With three vertices, it produces
one triangle; with six vertices, it produces two; and so on.  There are
seven primitives for drawing points, lines, and triangles:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/06/gl-primitives.png" width="515" height="251"></p>

<p class="np">In this illustration, the vertices are labeled in the order in which they
would be specified between <i>glBegin</i>() and <i>glEnd</i>().</p>

<p>The <i>GL_TRIANGLES</i> primitive, as
I've said, produces separate triangles.  <i>GL_TRINAGLE_STRIP</i> produces a strip of
connected triangles.  After the first vertex, every pair of additional vertices
adds another triangle.  Note the order of the vertices: Odd numbered vertices are
on one side of the strip; even number vertices are on the other side.
In a <i>GL_TRIANGLE_FAN</i>, the first vertex becomes the basis of the fan and is
connected to all the other vertices.  After the first two vertices, each additional vertex
will add another triangle to the fan.  Note that triangle fans can be used to
draw polygons.</p>

<p>Points are easy.  The <i>GL_POINTS</i> primitive produces one point for each
vertex that is specified.  By default, the size of a point is one pixel.
With <i>GL_LINES</i>, each pair of vertices produces a line segment joining
those points.  <i>GL_LINE_STRIP</i> produces a series of line segments
joining all the vertices.  And <i>GL_LINE_LOOP</i> is similar to <i>GL_LINE_STRIP</i>
except that one additional line segment is drawn connecting the last vertex to the
first vertex.  The default width for lines is one pixel.</p>

<hr class="break">

<p>In the above example, each vertex is specified by calling the function
<i>glVertex3f</i>().  There are actually quite a few functions for specifying
vertices.  The function names all start with "glVertex".  The suffix, such
as "3f", gives information about the parameters that are supplied to the function.
This is a very common pattern in OpenGL, so it's worth paying attention to how
it works.  In "glVertex3f", the "3" means that 3 numbers will be provided in
the parameter list, and the "f" means that the numbers are of type <i>float</i>.
The "f" could be replaced by "d" for numbers of type <i>double</i> or by
"i" for numbers of type <i>int</i>.  The "3" can be replaced by "2",
meaning that just two coordinates will be provided.  In that case, the two
coordinates are <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, and the <i>z</i> coordinate is
set to 0, so you are effectively drawing in 2D on the <i>xy</i>-plane.
For example, to  draw a 1-by-1 square with vertices at 0 and&nbsp;1,
one could use:
</p>

<pre>glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE_FAN);
glVertex2i(0,0);
glVertex2i(1,0);
glVertex2i(1,1);
glVertex2i(0,1);
glEnd();
</pre>

<p>There is one more important variation:  It is possible to add a "v" to the end of the
name.  This means that there will be only one parameter, which will be an array that contains
the coordinates.  The number of coordinates is still given by a number in the function
name, not by the length of the array.  In fact, in the C API, the parameter is actually
a pointer to the data.  In C, arrays and pointers are in many ways interchangeable, and the
use of a pointer as the parameter adds flexibility to the way the coordinate data can
be represented.  For example, it is common to put all the coordinate data into one
big array and to specify individual vertices using pointers that point into the
middle of the array.  Here's an example for people who know&nbsp;C:</p>

<pre>float coords[] = { 0,0.5, -0.5,-0.5, 0.5,-0.5 };

glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
glVertex2fv(coords);     // array name is a pointer to the start of the array
glVertex2fv(&amp;coords[2]); // &amp;coords[2] is a pointer to second element in array
glVertex2fv(&amp;coords[4]); // &amp;coords[4] is a pointer to fourth element in array
glEnd();
</pre>

<p class="np">The family of functions with names consisting of "glVertex" with
all its possible suffixes is often referred to as <i>glVertex*</i>.</p>

</div>



<div class="subsection">
<h3>Color</h3>

<p>Functions from the family <i>glColor*</i> can be used to specify colors for
the geometry that we draw.  For example, <i>glColor3f</i> has as parameters three floating
points numbers that give the red, green, and blue components of the color as
numbers in the range 0.0 to&nbsp;1.0.  (In fact, values outside this range are allowed,
even negative values.  When color values are used in computations, out-of-range values
will be used as given.  When a color actually appears on the screen, its component
values are clamped to the range&nbsp;0&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.  That is, values less than zero
are changed to zero, and values greater than one are changed to one.)</p>

<p>You can add a fourth component to the color by using <i>glColor4f</i>().  The fourth
component, known as alpha, is not used in the default drawing mode, but it is possible to configure
OpenGL to use it as the degree of transparency of the color, similarly to the use of the
alpha component in Java graphics.</p>

<p>If you would like to use integer color values in the range 0 to 255, you can use
<i>glColor3ub</i>() or <i>glColor4ub</i> to set the color.  In these function names,
"ub" stands for "unsigned byte."  <span class="newword">Unsigned byte</span> is an eight-bit
data type with values in the range 0 to 255.</p>

<p>There are also versions of these functions with names ending in "v":
<i>glColor3fv</i>(), <i>glColor4fv</i>(), <i>glColor3ubv</i>(), <i>glColor4ubv</i>().
These functions have one parameter that is a pointer to an array that contains the
color component values.  In fact, there are may other variations in the <i>glColor*</i>
family of functions, but the one's I have mentioned are probably the most common.
Here are some examples of commands for setting drawing colors in OpenGL:
</p>

<pre>glColor3f(0,0,0);         // Draw in black.

glColor3f(1,0,0);         // Draw in red.

glColor3ub(1,0,0);        // Draw in a color just a tiny bit different from
                          // black.  (The suffix, "ub" or "f", is significant!)

glColor3ub(255,0,0);      // Draw in red.

glColor4f(1, 0, 0, 0.5);  // Draw in transparent red, but only if OpenGL
                          // has been configured to do transparency.  By
                          // default this is the same as drawing in plain red.

float darkCyan[] = { 0.0, 0.5, 0.5 };
glColor3fv(darkCyan);     // Draw in a dark blue/green color.
</pre>

<p>Using any of these functions sets the value of a "current color."  When you
generate a vertex with one of the <i>glVertex*</i> functions, the current color
is saved along with the vertex coordinates as an <span class="newword">attribute</span>
of the vertex.  We'll see that vertices can have other kinds of attribute as well
as color.  One interesting point about OpenGL is that colors are associated with
individual vertices, not with complete shapes.  By changing the current color
between calls to <i>glBegin</i>() and <i>glEnd</i>(), you can get a shape in which
different vertices have different color attributes.  When you do this, OpenGL
will compute the colors of pixels inside the shape by
<span class="newword">blending</span> the colors of the vertices.  (Again, since
OpenGL is extremely configurable, I have to note that blending is just the
default behavior.)  For example, here is a triangle in which the three vertices
are assigned the colors red, green, and blue:</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/06/triangle.jpg" width="323" height="305"></p>

<p class="np">This image is often used as a kind of "Hello World" example for
OpenGL.  Here's the C code that was used to draw it:</p>

<pre>
glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
glColor3f( 1, 0, 0 ); // red
glVertex2f( -0.5, -0.5 );
glColor3f( 0, 1, 0 ); // green
glVertex2f( 0.5, -0.5 );
glColor3f( 0, 0, 1 ); // blue
glVertex2f( 0, 0.5 );
glEnd();
</pre>

<p>Note that you do <b>not</b> have to explicitly set a color for each vertex, as was done here.
If you want a shape that is all one color, you just have to set the current color
once, before drawing the shape (or just after the call to <i>glBegin</i>().)</p>

<hr class="break">
    
<p>It would be possible to clear the drawing area to a background color by drawing a
colored rectangle, but OpenGL has a potentially more efficient way to do it.  The
function</p>

<pre>glClearColor(r,g,b,a);
</pre>

<p class="np">sets up the color to be used for clearing.
The parameters are floating point values in the range 0 to&nbsp;1, and there are no variants of
this function.  The default clear color is black, with 0 for all the color components.
To fill the drawing area with the clear color, call</p>

<pre>glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT );
</pre>

<p class="np">The parameter is a constant integer that says that it is the drawing
area that is being cleared.  The correct term for what I have been calling the drawing
area is the <span class="newword">color buffer</span>, where buffer is a general term
referring to a region in memory.  OpenGL uses several buffers in addition to the
color buffer.  We will encounter the "depth buffer" very soon.  It is possible to use
<i>glClear</i>() to clear several buffers at the same time by combining the
constants that represent them with a logical OR operation.  For example,</p>

<pre>glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT );
</pre>

<p class="np">We will generally use <i>glClear</i>() in this form.</p>


</div>


<div class="subsection">
<h3>The Hidden Surface Problem and the Depth Test</h3>
<p>An obvious point about viewing in 3D is that one object can be behind
another object.  When this happens, the back object is hidden from the viewer
by the front object.  When we create an image of a 3D world, we have to
make sure that objects that are supposed to be hidden behind other objects
are in fact not visible in the image.  This is the <span class="newword">hidden
surface problem</span>.</p>

<p>The solution might seem simple enough:  Just draw the objects in order from
back to front.  If one object is behind another, the back object will be covered
up later when the front object is drawn.  This is called the
<span class="newword">painter's algorithm</span>.  It's essentially what you
are used to doing in 2D.  Unfortunately, it's not so easy to implement.
First of all, you can have objects that intersect, so that part of each
object is hidden by the other.  Whatever order you draw the objects in,
there will be some points where the wrong object is visible. To fix this, you would have to cut
the objects into pieces, along the intersection, and treat the pieces as
as separate objects.  In fact, there can be problems even if there
are no intersecting objects:  It's possible to have three non-intersecting
objects where the first object hides part of the second, the second hides
part of the first, and the third hides part of the first. The painter's
algorithm will fail no matter which order you draw the three objects.
The solution again is to cut the objects into pieces, but now it's not
so obvious where to cut. Consider the famous
example of the Borromean rings (public domain image from
<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Borromean_Rings_Illusion.png">wikimedia</a>):

<p align="center"><img src="images/06/Borromean_Rings.png" width="242" height="240" border=1></p>

<p class="np">Even though these problems can be solved, there is another issue.
The correct drawing order can change when the point of view is changed or when a geometric
transformation is applied, which means that the correct drawing order has to be
recomputed every time that happens.  In an animation, that would mean for every
frame.</p>

<p>So, OpenGL does not use the painter's algorithm.  Instead, it uses a technique
called the <span class="newword">depth test</span>.  The depth test solves the
hidden surface problem no matter what order the objects are drawn in, so you can
draw them in any order you want!   The depth test requires that an extra number
be stored for each pixel in the image.  This extra memory makes up the
<span class="newword">depth buffer</span> that I mentioned earlier.
During the drawing process, the depth buffer is used to keep track of what is currently
visible at each pixel.  When a second object is drawn at that pixel, the
information in the depth buffer can be used to decide whether the new object
is in front of or behind the object that is currently visible there.  If the
new object is in front, then the color of the pixel is changed to show the
new object, and the depth buffer is also updated.  If the new object is
behind the current object, then the data for the new object is discarded and
the color and depth buffers are left unchanged.</p>

<p>By default, the depth test is <b>not</b> turned on, which can lead to very
bad results when drawing in 3D.  You can enable the depth test by calling</p>

<pre>glEnable( GL_DEPTH_TEST );
</pre>

<p class="np">It can be turned off by calling <tt>glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST)</tt>.
(There are many OpenGL settings that are turned on and off using
<i>glEnable/glDisable</i>.)</p>

<p>You don't necessarily need to know any more about how the depth test actually
works,  but here are some details:  For each pixel, the depth buffer stores a
representation of the distance from the user of the point that is currently
visible at that pixel.  This value is essentially the <i>z</i>-coordinate
of the point, after transformations have been applied.  (In fact, the
depth buffer is often called the <span class="newword">z-buffer</span>.)
The possible <i>z</i>-coordinates are scaled to the range 0 to&nbsp;1.
The value 1 in the depth buffer represents the background, which is
behind any object that can be drawn.  When you clear the depth buffer,
it is filled with a 1 at each pixel. 
In OpenGL, the range of <i>z</i>-coordinates can be shown must be limited;
the use of the depth buffer is the reason for this limitation.
</p>

<p>The depth buffer algorithm can give some strange results when two objects
lie at exactly the same distance from the user.  Logically, it's not even
clear which object should be visible, but the real problem with the depth
test is that it might show one object at some points and the second object
at some other points.  This is possible because numerical calculations are
not perfectly accurate.  Here an actual example:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/06/depthTestError.png" width="507" height="228"></p>

<p class="np">In the two pictures shown here, a gray square was drawn, followed
by a white square, followed by a black square.  The squares all lie in the same
plane.  A very small rotation was applied, to make the computer do some calculations.
The picture on the right was drawn with the depth test disabled.  On the left,
the depth test was enabled, and you can see the strange result.</p>

<p>By the way, the discussion here assumes that there are no transparent
objects.  Unfortunately, the depth test does not handle transparency correctly.</p>

</div>




<div class="subsection">
<h3>Geometric Transformations in 3D</h3>

<p>We've seen that geometric transformations are an important part of 2D computer
graphics.  In three dimensions, they become even more essential.
The three basic types of transformation&mdash;scaling, rotation, and
translation&mdash;extend to three dimensions with just a few changes.  Translation
is easiest.  In 2D, a translation adds some number onto each coordinate.  The
same is true in 3D; we just need three numbers, to specify the amour of motion
in the direction of each of the coordinate axes.  A translation by (<i>tx,ty,tz</i>)
transforms the point (<i>x,y,z</i>) to (<i class="nb">x+tx, y+ty, z+tz</i>).</p>

<p>Similarly, a 3D scaling transformation requires three scale factors, one
to specify the amount of scaling in each of the coordinate directions.
A scaling by (<i>sx,sy,sz</i>) transforms the point (<i>x,y,z</i>) to
(<i class="nb">x*sx, y*sy, z*sz</i>).</p>

<p>Rotation is harder.  First, you need to understand a little more about
three-dimensional coordinate systems.  The standard OpenGL
coordinate system is a <span class="newword">right-handed coordinate system</span>.
The term comes from the fact that if you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction from
the positive <i>x</i>-axis to the positive <i>y</i>-axis, and extend your thumb out
from your fist, then your thumb will point in the direction of the positive
<i>z</i>-axis.  If you do this for the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>-axes in on the
screen in OpenGL's standard orientation, then your thumb will point towards your face.
There are also left-handed coordinate systems, where curling the
fingers of your <b>left</b> hand from the positive <i>x</i>-axis to the positive
<i>y</i>-axis will point your left thumb in the direction of the positive <i>z</i>-axis.
Note that the left/right handed distinction is not a property of the world, just
of the way that one chooses to lay out coordinates on the world.  You can transform
a right-handed system to a left-handed system with the right kind of geometric transformation.
For example, scaling by (1,1,&minus;1) would do so.  That transformation represents
a reflection through the <i>xy</i>-plane, and it reverses the orientation of the
<i>z</i>-axis.  We'll see in a minute how the left-handed/right-handed distinction
applies to rotations.</p>

<p>In 2D, rotation is rotation about a point, which we usually
select to be the origin.  In 3D, rotation is rotation about a line, which is called
the <span class="newword">axis of rotation.</span>  Think of the Earth rotating
about its axis.  The axis of rotation stays fixed, and points that are not on the
axis move in circles about the axis.  Any line can be an axis of rotation, but
we generally use an axis that passes through the origin.  The most
common rotations are rotation about the <i>x</i>-axis, rotation about the <i>y</i>-axis,
and rotation about the <i>z</i>-axis, but it's convenient to be able to use any line
through the origin as the axis.  There is an easy way to specify the line: Just specify one other
point that is on the line, in addition to the origin.   That's how things are
done in OpenGL:  An axis of rotation is specified by three numbers,
(<i>dx,dy,dz</i>), which are not all zero.  The axis is the line
through (0,0,0) and (<i>dx,dy,dz</i>).  To specify a rotation transformation in 3D,
you have to specify an axis and the angle of rotation about that axis.</p>

<p>We still have to account for the difference between positive and negative
angles.  We can't just say clockwise or counterclockwise.  If you look down on
the rotating Earth from above the North pole, you see a clockwise rotation; if you
look down on it from about the South pole, you see a counterclockwise rotation.
So, the difference between the two is not well-defined.  To define the
direction of rotation in 3D, we use the <span class="newword">right-hand rule</span>:
Point the extended thumb of your right hand in the direction from (0,0,0) to
(<i>dx,dy,dz</i>), where (<i>dx,dy,dz</i>) is the point that specifies the axis of
rotation.  Then the direction of rotation for positive angles is given by the
direction in which your fingers curl.  However, I need to emphasize that the right-hand
rule only works if you are using a right-handed coordinate system.  If you have
switched to a left-handed coordinate system, then you need to use a
left-hand rule to determine the direction of rotation for positive angles.
</p>

<hr class="break">
    
<p>The functions for doing geometric transformations in OpenGL are
<i>glScalef</i>(), <i>glRotatef</i>(), and <i>glTranslatef</i>().  The "f" indicates
that the parameters are of type float.  There are also versions ending in "d" to
indicate parameters of type double.  As you would expect, 3D scaling and translation
require three parameters.  Rotation requires four parameters: The first is the
angle of rotation measured in degrees (not radians), and the other three parameters
specify the axis of rotation.  In the command <i>glRotatef</i>(<i>angle,dx,dy,dz</i>),
the rotation axis is the line through the points (0,0,0) and (<i>dx,dy,dz</i>).
At least one of <i>dx</i>, <i>dy</i>, and <i>dz</i> should be non-zero.  Here are a
few examples:</p>

<pre>glScalef(2,2,2);        // Uniform scaling by a factor of 2.

glScalef(0.5,1,1);      // Shrink by half in the x-direction only.

glScalef(0,0,-1);       // Reflect through the xy-plane.

glTranslatef(1,0,0);    // Move 1 unit in the positive x-direction.

glTranslatef(3,5,-7.5); // Move (x,y,z) to (x+3, y+5, z-7.5)

glRotatef(90,1,0,0);    // Rotate 90 degrees about the x-axis.
                        // Moves the +y axis onto the +z axis
                        //    and the +z axis onto the -y axis.
                        
glRotatef(-90,-1,0,0);  // Has exactly the same effect as the previous rotation.

glRotatef(90,0,1,0);    // Rotate 90 degrees about the y-axis.
                        // Moves the +z axis onto the +x axis
                        //    and the +x axis onto the -z axis.
                        
glRotatef(90,0,0,1);    // Rotate 90 degrees about the z-axis.
                        // Moves the +x axis onto the +y axis
                        //    and the +y axis onto the -x axis.
                        
glRotatef(30,1.5,2,-3); // Rotate 30 degrees about the line through
                        //    the points (0,0,0) and (1.5,2,-3).
</pre>

<p>The function <i>glLoadIdentity</i>() can be called to discard any transformations
that have been applied.  It takes no parameters.  The <span class="newword">identity transformation</span>
is one that has no effect; that is, it leaves every point fixed.  Calling
<i>glLoadIdentity</i>() gives you a known starting point for setting up transformations.</p>

<p>You already know that when doing hierarchical modeling, you need to be able to save
the current transformation and restore it later.  And you know that one way to do that
is with a matrix stack.  OpenGL has direct support for matrix stacks.  Calling
<i>glPushMatrix</i>() saves a copy of the current transformation on the matrix stack.
Calling <i>glPopMatrix</i>() restores a transformation that was saved by <i>glPushMatrix</i>() 
by removing the top transformation from the stack and installing
it as the current transformation.</p>

<hr class="break">
    
<p>As a simple example, we will draw a 1-by-1-by-1 cube centered at the origin, where
each face of the cube is a different color.  For convenience, we use a short function
to draw a square in a specified color.  The square is drawn with its center
at the point (0,0,0.5), so that it is in position to be the front face of the
cube.</p>

<pre>
void square(float r, float g, float b) {
    glColor3f(r,g,b);         // The color for the square.
    glTranslatef(0,0,0.5);    // Move square 0.5 units forward.
    glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE_FAN);
    glVertex2f(-0.5,-0.5);    // Draw the square (before the
    glVertex2f(0.5,-0.5);     //   the translation is applied)
    glVertex2f(0.5,0.5);      //   on the xy-plane, with its
    glVertex2f(-0.5,0.5);     //   at (0,0,0).
    glEnd();
}
</pre>

<p class="np">Given this function, we can draw the cube as follows.
In this code, the cube is rotated so that several faces are visible; without the
rotation, only the front face would be visible.  The <i>square</i>()
function can be used to draw the front face directly, but the call
to that function is still surrounded by <i>glPushMatrix/glPopMatrix</i>
to prevent the translation inside the function from affecting the
rest of the drawing.  We can get the other faces of the cube by
rotating the square from its original position to make it coincide
with one of the other faces of the cube.  For example, we get the
back face of the cube by rotating 180 degrees about the <i>y</i>-axis,
and the top face by rotating &minus;90 degrees about the <i>x</i>-axis.
Each face uses <i>glPushMatrix/glPopMatrix</i> to make sure that the
transformations that are applied to the face affect <i>only</i>
that face.</p>

<pre>
glLoadIdentity();     // start with no transformation 

glRotatef(15,0,1,0);  // rotate the cube 15 degrees about y-axis
glRotatef(15,1,0,0);  // rotate the cube 15 degrees about x-axis

// Now, draw the six faces of the cube by drawing its six faces.

glPushMatrix();
square(1,0,0);        // front face is red
glPopMatrix();

glPushMatrix();
glRotatef(180,0,1,0); // rotate square to back face
square(0,1,1);        // back face is cyan
glPopMatrix();

glPushMatrix();
glRotatef(-90,0,1,0); // rotate square to left face
square(0,1,0);        // left face is green
glPopMatrix();

glPushMatrix();
glRotatef(90,0,1,0); // rotate square to right face
square(1,0,1);       // right face is magenta
glPopMatrix();

glPushMatrix();
glRotatef(-90,1,0,0); // rotate square to top face
square(0,0,1);        // top face is blue
glPopMatrix();

glPushMatrix();
glRotatef(90,1,0,0); // rotate square to bottom face
square(1,1,0);        // bottom face is yellow
glPopMatrix();

<h3>Introduction to the Projection Transformation</h3>

<p>The coordinate transformations that I have been discussing here operate on 3D space.
They make up what is called the <span class="newword">modelview</span> transformation,
since it is used for geometric modeling and for selecting the point of view.
But we also need another type of transformation: the <span class="newword">projection</span>
transformation that maps the 3D world onto a 2D viewing surface.  I will come back to the
whole topic of transforms later, but for now, there are a few things you need to know.</p>

<p>The first point is that OpenGL keeps the projection transformation separate from the
modelview transformation.  The projection transformation is always applied last, no matter when
you specify it.  Unfortunately, the same set of functions can be used to manipulate both
kinds of transform, so you have to tell OpenGL which transformation you want to work on.
This is done with the <i>glMatrixMode</i>() function.  To start working on the
projection transformation, call</p>

<pre>glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION );
</pre>

<p class="np">To go back to working on the modelview transformation, call</p>

<pre>glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW );
</pre>

<p class="np">It's common to leave the matrix mode set to <i>GL_MODELVIEW</i>, except
when you are actually working in another mode.  Here is the code that might be used
to set up the projection:</p>

<pre>
glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glLoadIdentity();
glOrtho( xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax );
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
</pre>

<p class="np">The <i>glOrtho</i> command does the work.  The parameters specify the ranges
of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> that will be visible in the drawing area, and the
projection is done by discarding the <i>z</i>-coordinate.  This type of projection is
not very realistic, and we will look at alternatives later.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Lighting, Materials, and Normal Vectors</h3>

<p>Another aspect of 3D graphics that I will mostly defer for now is the effect of
lighting on a scene.  To get a realistic scene, you have to simulate light sources
and the interaction of light with objects in the scene.  OpenGL uses a very simplified
lighting model, but it can still add significantly to the realism of an image.
However, by default, lighting calculations are disabled.  To enable them, you
have to call
</p>

<pre>
glEnable( GL_LIGHTING );  // enable lighting calculations
glEnable( GL_LIGHT0 );    // turn on light source number 0
</pre>

<p class="np">This turns on very basic lighting, with a single light source of white
light that shines from the direction of the viewer onto the scene. However, when you
do this, everything in the scene will be a dull gray color.  The problem is that
the lighting calculation uses something called <span class="newword">material</span>
instead of simple color.  A surface's material properties determine how it interacts
with light.  In addition to simple color, it can include properties such as texture
and reflectivity.  Fortunately, it's possible to tell OpenGL to treat the color
as specified  by <i>glColor*</i> as the basic material color.  You can do this
by calling</p>

<pre>glEnable( GL_COLOR_MATERIAL );  // use glColor* values as material color
</pre>

<p>Another factor that enters into the lighting calculation is the angle at
which light hits a surface.  Light that shines directly on a surface illuminates
it more brightly than light that hits the surface at a glancing angle.  However,
to determine this angle, OpenGL needs to know what direction the surface is
facing.  This direction is determined by the <span class="newword">normal vector</span>
to the surface.  A normal vector indicates the direction that is perpendicular
to the surface.</p>

<p>We will return to the topic of lighting, material, and normal vectors in much more
detail in a later section.</p>
